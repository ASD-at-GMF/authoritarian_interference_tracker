Tactics included digital surveillance, hacking, harassment, intimidation of families in China, and smear campaigns. The investigation exposed systematic efforts by PRC authorities and their proxies to silence critics abroad using both online and offline methods. Canadian lawmakers from multiple parties urged the newly elected government to enforce the recently passed Countering Foreign Interference Act and to take immediate steps to protect targeted individuals. Adopted in June 2024, the Bill is supposed to “counter the rising threat of transnational repression and foreign interference in Canada by giving government departments and agencies more powers to fight it and by creating a foreign agent registry and a foreign interference transparency commissioner”. </p>",

According to the joint advisory, at least one Canadian telecommunications provider was breached in mid-February 2025. The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in network edge infrastructure, specifically older Cisco routers, to gain access and collect sensitive data. The Cyber Centre warned that Salt Typhoon was still targeting Canadian entities and was likely to persist in doing so over the next two years. In a separate advisory from April 2025, the Cyber Centre had already singled out Salt Typhoon as “ targeting network edge routers across critical infrastructure sectors”.</p>",

The campaign originated on WeChat through the anonymous account Youli‑Youmian, which Canadian intelligence links to the CCP’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. The operation amplified both positive and negative narratives about Carney, including his stance on relations with the United States and his qualifications for office. Analysts observed coordinated posting activity on March 10 and again during the writ period on March 25. Approximately 30 WeChat accounts reposted content in close sequence, a tactic identified as inauthentic amplification. The operation generated between 85,000 and 130,000 interactions and potentially reached 1 to 3 million users. Despite its scale, Canadian officials determined the campaign did not compromise the integrity of the election. A Liberal Party representative was briefed on the findings, and the SITE Task Force raised the issue with Tencent, WeChat’s developer. Canada describes the SITE Task Force as the country’s “principal mechanism to monitor the threat from hostile state interference during elections”.</p>",

In December 2024, Hong Kong police issued a warrant and placed a bounty on Tay as one of six overseas democracy activists accused of violating Hong Kong’s national security law. In addition, Canadian intelligence identified a coordinated online repression campaign designed to discredit Tay and suppress information about his candidacy. The campaign involved amplification of narratives about the arrest warrant and his political competence across platforms including Facebook, WeChat, TikTok, RedNote, and Douyin. Intelligence officials also observed keyword filtering of Tay’s name in Chinese characters on PRC-based platforms. Canadian authorities classified the effort as a transnational repression operation, noting that one Facebook account involved was historically linked to PRC authorities in Hong Kong. While the campaign had limited engagement, officials flagged it as a deliberate and persistent attempt to manipulate voter perceptions in a diaspora-rich riding with a history of foreign interference.

According to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians’ report, between 175 and 200 Chinese international students arrived at the nomination contest on buses arranged by the PRC Consulate. PRC officials gave these students falsified documentation, breaking the LPC’s requirement that only a district’s residents can vote in nomination contests there. PRC officials also told students that their student visas would be jeopardized if they did not vote for Dong and reportedly looked to physically intimidate other voters. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service assessed that this played a “significant role” in Dong’s narrow victory. Dong maintains that his campaign was not involved in busing in international students from outside the district.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Officially, the OCAO manages overseas issues related to China, including liaising with the Chinese diaspora. However, in court, Canadian Immigration argued “that the nature of OCAO’s interactions with the overseas Chinese communities, the information gathered, and the intended use of the gathered information is surreptitious,” — an assertation the judge upheld. UFWD is the CCP agency responsible for ensuring Party control of PRC society, including Chinese businesspeople and members of the Chinese diaspora such as Huang, and has been linked to cases of political interference around the world.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The hackers compromised ICAO’s servers and website, and used them as a springboard to access employee data and other information at other organizations. However, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation revealed in 2019 that ICAO, headed by Secretary General Fang Liu, a former Chinese government official, obstructed investigations into the attack. James Wan, ICAO’s deputy director of information management and general administration, dismissed findings from New York-based UN IT analysts and, in December 2016, the ICT team he headed was formally accused of “acting with intent to disguise the source, nature and impact of a breach of the ICAO network.” According to Canadian media, the team was escorted out of the ICAO building on December 21, 2016 before being re-instated six weeks later after “pressure from higher up the United Nations chain.” According to the same media report, ICAO Secretary General Fang Liu “shelved internal recommendations to investigate the four ICT team members and James Wan.”</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

His remarks implied that a prisoner swap between the two nations is feasible. The Chinese, up and to this point, have repeatedly refuted claims that the detention and indictment of the two Canadians on espionage charges were retaliation for the legal proceedings against Meng Wanzhou. Additionally, the Chinese government has demanded the Canadian government put an end to extradition proceedings. The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, responded that the judicial system in Canada is independent and the federal government cannot intercede. Trudeau faces contradictory pressures from some parts of the Canadian political spectrum to be tougher on China, and from others to release Meng altogether.",

Mr. Jiancheng set up Chinese-Canadian conservative groups in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario as well as created a national organization called the Federation of Chinese Canadian Conservatives. The probe will focus on collusion between the Conservative party and the Chinese Canadian organizations to circumvent donation caps in Canadian election law. According to a Globe and Mail article, Mr. Jiancheng has close ties to members of the CCP, and has been a prominent donor to the Liberal party in the past. The Conservative party has denied the allegations of collusion.",

The Wall Street Journal reported days after the arrests that several former and current ambassadors familiar with the inner workings of the CCP saw the detention of the Canadian citizens as retaliation for the arrest of Ms. Wanzhou. Shortly after the arrest of Ms. Wanzhou, the Chinese Foreign Ministry threatened the Canadian government with severe consequences if she was not released. In June 2020, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that there was a direct link between the cases of Ms. Wanzhou and of the detained Canadians in China.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Freeland argued that the articles were part of a Kremlin-orchestrated smear campaign designed to delegitimize her office. In 2014, the Russian government issued Freeland a travel ban in repsponse to her advocacy for sanctions against Russian entities in the wake of the Crimean annexation and for her tough stance on Russian corruption. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled four Russian diplomats in March 2018 at least in part for using \"their diplomatic status to undermine Canada’s security or interfere in [its] democracy” by participating in the smear campaign.",

Gao's piece that criticized Wang was published via Gao’s social media account and did not appear in the Chinese-language newspaper for which he is a columnist. His editor informed him that the decision to end his column was the result of outside pressure. Similarly, another Canadian journalist, Xin Feng, received death threats after publishing a critical piece on Wang to the Canadian based Chinese-language website, 51.ca.

Critics have raised concerns about incidents of infringement upon intellectual freedom at some Confucius Institutes, whose terms of agreement are often hidden.

She had been hired in 2010, and left her job the following year, seeking asylum in Canada. She also says that she received training on how to promote government themes on controversial topics such as Tibet. The university ended its contract with the Confucius Institute in 2013. Confucius Institutes are language and culture centers run by the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Education, which are hosted in more than 500 universities around the world. Critics have raised concerns about incidents of infringement upon intellectual freedom at some Confucius Institutes, whose terms of agreement are often hidden. A former head of propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party has called them \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.\"",

While the impact was limited, the MIVD expressed concern over the increasing capabilities and intent of Russian cyber actors.

Among its donors was the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, an organization founded by the UFWD to promote Taiwan’s unification with mainland China. The PRC uses “United Front” work to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of the CCP. The CCP’s UFWD—the agency responsible for coordinating these kinds of influence operations—mostly focuses on the management of potential opposition groups inside China, but it also has an important foreign influence mission.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

According to an agreement between the Dutch institution and a publicly funded Chinese university in Chongqing, the center received approximately 300,000 euros per year in 2018, 2019, and 2020. NOS documented many pro-CCP statements made by members of the research center in Chinese state media and online. For instance, one of the researchers there wrote on LinkedIn that stories about labor camps in Xinjiang were “rumours” and decried “whatever lies the western media comes up with” about the region. As a result of NOS’ reporting, the Free University of Amsterdam announced it would be closing the research center in July 2022. The incident was highlighted as an example of Chinese interference in Europe during Ursula von der Leyen’s 2022 State of the European Union speech.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The Philippines had asked the court to rule on their territorial dispute in the South China Sea and on the validity of Chinese territorial claims in the region. The hackers implanted a malicious Adobe Flash file on the PCA’s website, using it as a springboard from which to infect other machines. The malware allowed the hackers to track the website visitors’ computers and access their confidential documents. The Diplomat reports that Chinese cyber units could have used their access to the computers of journalists, diplomats, lawyers, and others to gather information on the arguments they intended to use against China in the South China Sea arbitration. The attackers’ methodology was similar to that of the Naikon Chinese state-affiliated hacker group, also known as APT unit 78020, who had previously targeted several Southeast Asian countries.</p>",

According to Dutch media, the documents’ release coincided with the hacking of her email account, threatening messages on social media, and harassment of her acquaintances. In particular, her ex-husband claims to have been lured to Dubai where a Chinese man saying he worked for state intelligence told him to hack into his ex-wife’s computer, showing him videos of his mother being questioned by Chinese authorities. While reporters were unable to independently verify the ex-husband’s claims, his and Ms. Abdulaheb’s accounts are consistent with Chinese authorities’ harassment of Uyghurs in other European countries.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The assessment, which was kept confidential, found that Huawei could evesdrop on all conversations on KPN's network, which included those of the Prime Minister. Huawei also knew which numbers were monitored by Dutch police and intelligence services. Finally, the report also said that the Chinese company accessed the network core from China. KPN responded to the April 2021 article by saying it had never observed Huawei taking client information and that it conducted maintenance of the core network itself. But de Volkskrant reported the next day that management of KPN's 4G network is in fact still outsourced to Huawei. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.</p>",

On April 13, Dutch authorities apprehended the four men outside of the OPCW offices in a car that contained sophisticated electronic equipment used for hacking. Dutch intelligence services found sufficient evidence to prove that the GRU agents intended to compromise the building’s wireless network using an antenna hidden in their car. Because they entered the country with diplomatic passports, Dutch authorities expelled the four men rather than charge them with a crime. Russian state-sponsored media outlets such as Sputnik and RT claimed the event was staged.",

For example, according to The New York Times, a prominent campaigner against the agreement shared a false report from a Russian state-sponsored TV channel falsely claiming “Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a 3-year-old Russian-speaking boy in eastern Ukraine.” The report proved to be a hoax, and the supposed Ukrainian witness turned out to be a Russian actress. The agreement, which was ratified and implemented the following year despite the referendum's failure, established a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) between Ukraine and the EU and strengthened both political and economic ties between the two entities.",

This statement was connected to a device at a transport company in Jablonow,  Poland, catching fire, as well as to DHL packages catching fire at warehouses in Birmingham, United Kingdom, and at Leipzig airport in Germany prior to being loaded onto a flight in July 2024. Western intelligence officials believe that the incendiary packages were test runs for future operations in the United States. US intelligence intercepted Russian communications planning to place similar incendiary devices on American flights. The type of fire created were magnesium-based, greatly complicating the extinguishing processes. Magnesium fires are made worse when water is applied and require special powder-based extinguishers.</p>",

Microsoft warned that this attack indicates an increased risk to organizations that directly supply or transport humanitarian or military assistance to Ukraine.

The hacking and disinformation group, known as Ghostwriter, used two hacktivist personas to spread the message on Telegram. On June 16, one of the hacktivist groups, Beregini, posted a fake document from Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov to Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that laid out plans to send male Ukrainian refugees to the frontline. On June 17, the hacktivist persona JokerDPR claimed on Telegram to have documents showing Kuleba asking Polish officials to help with deportations. That same day, a Polish politician’s dormant social media account posted images purporting to show official correspondence that laid out the deportation program. JokerDPR then used those posts to validate its earlier claims. Multiple Russian state media outlets reported the assertions as fact. The Polish government said that at least one of the letters being pushed by the hacktivists was fake. Warsaw also noted that the falsified letters were sent to an undisclosed number of emails.  </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Russia President Vladimir Putin had previous ordered “unfriendly” nations to pay for gas in rubles, a move meant to stabilize Russia’s currency in the wake of sanctions sparked by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Poland and Bulgaria rely heavily on Russian gas exports, with Bulgaria getting more than 90 percent of its gas from Russia. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that Russia was using “gas as an instrument of blackmail.” Hours after Russia cut gas to Warsaw and Sofia, prices for natural gas in Europe spiked by more than 23 percent.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

According to Russian officials, Polish intelligence had attempted to co-opt members of the Ukrainian elite to go along with the landgrab. The site NewsFront, which has been tied to Russian intelligence, argued that Poland is famous for “its hysterically expansive behavior” and is now rushing to “seize a piece of the collapsing Ukraine.” Other Moscow-funded outlets pushed similar lines. The General Command of the Polish Armed Forces denied that Poland has any plans to invade Ukraine. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Russian state media amplified President Vladimir Putin’s lie that Belarusian airlines had not carried migrants.

A Telegram channel that originated in Russia in 2013 leaked information from the hacks, including details from the Polish prime minister’s office relating to armaments purchases and the country’s coronavirus response. Polish security officials said the campaign was designed to amplify divisions within Poland and to strain ties between Poland and its Western partners.

The most suspicious activity concerns numerous Twitter accounts that responded to posts from the U.S. and Chinese ambassadors with pro-China messages. The combination of imperfect translations, consistent mass targeting of the U.S. ambassador posts, and often recent creation of accounts with few other tweets suggest the work of bots. Additionally, U.S. sources and media reports suggest that Chinese cooperation to deliver medical equipment and supplies only occurred once Polish President Andrzej Duda agreed to China's President Xi Jinping to thank him, a call that was then heralded by Chinese authorities. This was in addition to more conventional public diplomacy initiatives such the publication of pieces by China's ambassador published in a leading Polish newspaper. Even those were criticized as crudely and uncritically reproducing the CCP's propaganda.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Wang Weijing, a sales director for Huawei in Poland, and Piotr Durbajlo, a former employee of Poland's internal security agency who then worked for a French telecommunications company, face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Durbajlo reportedly worked on constructing safeguard systems for classified Polish government networks, and he had traveled to China on multiple occasions with Wang, including at least once to Huawei's headquarters. Wang had served in China's embassy in Poland before working for Huawei. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP. Huawei has since fired Wang from his job with the company, but Polish government officials have highlighted this episode as evidence of the risks of allowing unrestricted Huawei access to 5G infrastructure in the country.",

Dodik is the head of the ethnic-Serb component of the Bosnian federation, and the photograph was released with text that “vaguely hinted that Russia was ready to carry out a Crimea-style operation in Bosnia” if Dodik was not re-elected. Usovsky, who actively supports various pro-Russian projects in Poland, complied with the request. Malofeyev is sanctioned by the EU and the U.S. Treasury Department for “fund[ing] separatist activities in eastern Ukraine.”",

Confucius Institutes are language and culture centers run by the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Education, which are hosted in more than 500 universities globally. Critics have raised concerns about incidents of infringement upon intellectual freedom at Confucius Institutes, whose terms of agreement and financial details are often hidden. A former head of propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party has called them \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.\" Polish universities currently host five CIs, which have to accept some personnel and financing provided through Hanban, the CI governing body in China. Host universities also have to accept \"by-laws\" of CIs, including provisions regarding obedience to Chinese regulations that would not provide for the same level of free speech protections that most Western constitutions guarantee. Polish reports suggest that the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize award to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, and treatment of the Uyghur minority in China would not receive coverage in CI programming. A proposal for a sixth Polish CI, at the University of Warsaw, was halted in 2015 following student protests over similar concerns about censorship relating to Tibet, Taiwan, human rights violations, and other subjects.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Over the past decade, the firm invested at least 20 million euros to set up a factory in Koby?ka, Poland to produce the newest models of its equipment. The company was founded by the son of former Chinese president Hu Jintao, and as of April 2019, a majority of the firm's shares were under the ownership of China National Nuclear Corporation, which is also state-run. Nuctech reportedly provides machines via at least 50 public contracts - worth around $150 million in total - with European organizations since 2014, and analysts believe Nuctech has signed numerous additional deals with private partners. The machines and associated software offer access to data regarding passengers, material cargo, or other potentially sensitive information, and U.S. security officials have raised concerns about weaponization via hacking in a potential future crisis that could shut down a critical component of the transit supply chain. European observers have raised concerns about a \"massive low-level pricing strategy\" that Nuctech reportedly uses to grow market share and bypass competitors that may lack the subsidies available to a state-run firm, and EU regulators applied anti-dumping duties against the company in 2010 for unfair competition practices.",

One report suggests that the think tank accepts money from the Chinese government, and lack of clarity regarding donors - individual or otherwise - gives reason to these concerns. The report also notes that CSPA's founder has, as of 2016, taken a position as deputy director of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a vehicle for Chinese and European economic cooperation that China hopes to develop as an alternative to perceived U.S. dominance of institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. In another instance of biased initiatives, attendees on a think tank trip to China claim that the sponsored events stressed positive elements of government and society, but \"extremely limited\" opportunities to engage with anything not vetted by the hosts and included police escorts throughout the trip.",

The article was accompanied by a video in which a woman, whom Microsoft identified as an actor, claimed to be the victim of the crash. Online posts by right-leaning users citing the story were viewed millions of times.

Both videos were widely circulated on social media, notably on X, where they amassed hundreds of thousands of views. In a joint statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) claimed the videos were part of Russia’s broader strategy to undermine trust in the election and stoke divisions. A CNN investigation later revealed that a registered Russian agent based in Australia paid an unwitting conservative social media influencer in Massachusetts $100 to post the video.

The network, also known as Portal Kombat and comprising approximately 150 sites, published over 3.6 million articles in 2024. Rather than producing original content, Pravda aggregates “content from Russian state media, pro-Kremlin influencers, and government agencies and officials through a broad set of seemingly independent websites”. This content is then lifted from the internet and incorporated into the training data of major AI chatbots. NewsGuard's study found that one-third of the time, these chatbots echoed narratives from the Pravda network, including at least 207 provably false claims, many related to Ukraine. This strategy, termed \"Large-Language Model Grooming\" by the American Sunlight Project, aims to manipulate AI outputs by saturating training data with pro-Russian narratives.​</p>",

The group had previously breached into AT&amp;T, Verizon, Lumen Technologies, and other international telecom networks, notably exploiting vulnerabilities in Cisco Systems routers. Investigators believed that the group employed advanced methods, including artificial intelligence, to infiltrate US telecom infrastructure over at least eight months. The hackers accessed cellphone lines used by senior national security and policy officials, as well as prominent politicians, including then-former President Donald J. Trump and his running mate JD Vance. This access potentially allowed the attackers to collect call logs, unencrypted texts, and communication patterns. They also infiltrated systems used for US surveillance compliance, further heightening counterintelligence concerns. In January 2025, the US Department of Treasury tied Salt Typhoon to the Ministry of State Security, the PRC’s main civilian intelligence agency.</p>",

The company allegedly posted thousands of English-language videos to multiple social media sites, which garnered over 16 million views on YouTube alone. The videos contained commentary on US issues like immigration, inflation, and domestic and foreign policy, seeking to amplify divisions in the US and weaken international support for Ukraine. Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva used shell companies and fake identities, posing as outside editors, to conceal RT’s involvement. They were charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>",

The domains spread narratives that aimed to sway opinions in swing states, promote isolationist sentiments around US aid to Ukraine, and amplify false information about the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.

The Washington Post reported that more than 35 pro-CCP groups with ties to the United Front from around the United States attended. The PRC consulate paid for their hotels and meals to incentivize participation and hired 60 private security guards to protect the groups. Footage showed PRC-linked Chinese diaspora group leaders as well as four PRC diplomats from the Los Angeles and San Francisco consulates in the crowd. Videos show pro-CCP activists attacking anti-Xi protesters with flagpoles, chemical spray, and physical force. There were more than a dozen attacks on protesters, leaving some hospitalized. Spokespeople from PRC consulates made statements that the pro-CCP groups attended voluntarily to welcome Xi, that they were the ones subject to violence, and evidence otherwise was fabricated. The PRC uses “United Front” work to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of the CCP. The CCP’s UFWD—the agency responsible for coordinating these kinds of influence operations—mostly focuses on the management of potential opposition groups inside China, but it also has an important foreign influence mission.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The report was based on interviews with Chinese students in the Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Interviewees explained that protesting students used masks to conceal their identity from agents of the PRC government. Those agents, which included students who were hired to spy on their classmates, frequented and surveilled the protests, photographing attendees and reporting them to PRC authorities. Several students reported that, within hours of attending protests abroad, PRC security officials contacted their parents in mainland China, threatening to revoke the parents’ passports, get them fired, prevent any future promotions, cut retirement benefits, or outright restrain their physical freedom. PRC authorities demanded that parents cut financial support to their children and prevent them from attending events that may harm the PRC’s reputation in the world.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Using AI to plagiarize, translate, and edit content from mainstream media outlets, CopyCop tailored articles to specific audiences, primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom and France, and published over 19,000 articles per month. Some of these sites imitated well-established outlets like the BBC.</p>\r\n<p>Using technical, behavioral, and contextual evidence, Recorded Future assessed that CopyCop was “likely aligned with the Russian government”. First, CopyCop domains were hosted on Russian infrastructure and had overlapping TLS certificates, implying they belonged to a single network. CopyCop had this kind of strong infrastructure ties to DCWeekly, a known disinformation outlet led by a US citizen who fled to Russia in 2016. Second, content published via the network was amplified by known Russian overt and covert influence assets, such as the Foundation to Battle Injustice financed by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin. CopyCop also consistently cited Russian state media outlets. The narratives represented in its articles reflected Russian objectives of undermining Western domestic and foreign policy, spurring distrust in and between governments, and weakening support for Ukraine. The network’s tactics, techniques and procedures also showed strong similarities to other known Russian state-sponsored networks conducting influence operations, such as Doppelgänger.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

McGonigal later accepted $17,500 from Deripaska to conduct opposition research on one of the oligarch’s rivals, Vladimir Potanin, with hopes of getting Potanin added to US blacklists. McGonigal pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. </span></div>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

In one instance, the FSB directed a project that sponsored US and European journalists to visit Ukraine to learn “the alleged truth” about what was happening in the country.

These campaigns have been linked to the same Russian agency, the Internet Research Agency, that is associated with interference in the 2016 US presidential election and in the 2020 elections. As in previous instances, these information operations involved using social media accounts to pose as enraged American voters, though this time they also sought to spread disinformation about the Russo-Ukrainian War and to undermine US support for Ukraine. Social media research companies, such as Recorded Future, Graphika, Mandiant, and the Stanford Internet Observatory, uncovered Russian information campaigns conducted on Gab, Parler, Getter, Truth Social, and other fringe social media platforms that typically attract right-wing users. In one instance, a troll created a fake Kid Rock fan account that was reposted by Donald Trump Jr., who shared it with over 6 million Instagram followers.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Her aim was to gather intelligence and influence up-and-coming U.S. politicians on China-related issues. One of the most significant targets of Fang’s efforts was Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell, helping him fundraise for his 2014 campaign. California is a highly strategic state due to the national influence its lawmakers derive from the state’s economic and technologic weight. The MSS has a unit dedicated to political intelligence and influence operations in the state. U.S. officials first noticed Fang through surveillance they were conducting on a suspected MSS officer working undercover as a diplomat in the San Francisco consulate. Fang unexpectedly left the country in mid-2015 as the investigation was under way.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

It aimed to censor criticism of Beijing abroad. During several weeks, Twitter accounts of the New Yorker's Jiayang Fan, the Economist's Alice Su, the New York Times' Muyi Xiao, and other journalists and China analysts, faced thousands of tweets calling them “traitors”.  These accounts attacked their physical appearance, questioned their credibility and the quality of their work, and, especially in the case of  Jiayang Fan, brought up intimate details of the journalists’ personal lives. ASPI identified and followed other activities similar to Spamouflage that took place over the course of several years across multiple platforms and languages. Twitter attributed the network to the Chinese government in 2019. Some of the accounts behind the harassment also shared topics aligning with the CCP’s narratives.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Influence campaigns included both overt means like public diplomacy, as well as covert means such as information collection on local leaders and their associates, or the weaponization of economic partnerships to incentivize pro-China behavior. The CCP used front groups such as the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, whose ostensible aim is to cultivate relationships between US localities and Beijing. The NCSC warned that the United Front sought to take advantage of US state and local leaders<em>’ </em>desire for a<em> “degree of independence from Washington</em>” to use them as proxies to improve US economic cooperation with China, as well as to reduce criticism of China’s policies towards Taiwan, Tibetans, Uyghurs, and others.</p>\r\n<p>China uses “United Front” work to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of the CCP.

After Safeguard Defenders first revealed the existence of 54 stations on September 12, 2022, 48 additional Chinese state-operated police stations were discovered globally. As of December 2022, the NGO identified four different Chinese local police jurisdictions as operating “overseas police service centers\" in at least 53 countries.

Under the MPS’ guidance, they were locating and monitoring Chinese dissidents. Following an FBI search of the police station in October 2022, Lu and Chen erased their communications with an MPS official to conceal their activities from the agency. According to the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York, Lu was already assisting the Chinese government’s repressive activities in the United States prior to the opening of the police station in early 2022. US authorities see this overseas police station as part of Chinese state-led global campaigns of transnational repression.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

It targeted American residents critical of the Chinese government. 34 MPS officers created fake social media accounts to intimidate and harass Chinese dissidents. They used the fake accounts to disseminate Chinese government propaganda and narratives. They also attempted to recruit US persons. With the help of a China-based employee, six MPS officers and two CAC officials also exploited a US telecommunications company to remove dissidents from the company's platform. They notably disrupted a dissident’s videoconference commemorating the Tiananmen Square Massacre by posting threats against the participants via the company platform’s chat function. The China-based employee also helped the MPS and CAC agents identify all accounts associated with the dissident. All defendants are believed to reside in China but are operating worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

According to the Senate report, an \"extended and effective Chinese malign influence and information theft campaign” has targeted The Fed since at least 2013. One of the Chinese government’s tactics to collect information from the Fed was to recruit US-based economists, in exchange for “monetary gain and other benefit”. As part of this operation, Chinese officials forcibly detained a Fed employee in China, and developed ties with Fed employees through the Xinhua News Agency Media. In addition, multiple Fed employees maintained close ties to Chinese academic organizations known to be affiliated with China’s Thousand Talents Program, the most famous of hundreds of Chinese programs aimed at gaining technology from abroad, sometimes through illegal or non-transparent means. The Senate report found that the Fed had so far been unable to counter the Chinese government’s malign influence and collection campaign.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Babakov, a member of the Russian Duma aligned with President Vladimir Putin, and two individuals working for him recruited at least one American to help Babakov connect with U.S. Members of Congress, including by having the American recruit offer an “all-expense paid” trip to a conference in part of Russia-controlled Crimea, where the Member of Congress was told they would receive an award. Babakov and his staff organized the event in Crimea, including by inviting Americans to attend and present at the conference. Those Americans were offered funding from a committee developed to support the Russian-backed government in Crimea. The Member of Congress declined the offer. Babakov and his staff also used a nonprofit organization based in Russia, called the Institute for International Integration Studies, as a front to push content aimed at weakening transatlantic unity, undermining Western sanctions on Russia, and eroding the sovereignty of Ukraine. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

On March 10, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said those U.S.-backed facilities were attempting to create bioagents capable of targeting specific ethnic groups and were training birds to deliver bioweapons. The ministry also claimed that the United States had used those labs to experiment with “especially dangerous pathogens” and that those tests had resulted in several virus outbreaks. In late March, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed that Hunter Biden, George Soros, and a range of U.S. government agencies were involved in financing and operating the biolabs. In April, Russian officials said that the United States had tested pathogens on patients in a Ukrainian psychiatric hospital and planned to spread typhus and hepatitis throughout Russia, Belarus, Poland, and Moldova. Kremlin-linked messengers also said that Germany was involved in the bioweapons program. In May, Russia’s Ministry of Defense asserted that leaders of the U.S. Democratic Party used the bioweapons program to generate money for political campaigns and said President Joe Biden had overseen the project. The ministry also said Poland and the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna were involved with the bioweapons facilities.    </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Using a piece of malware called Daxin, the hackers were able to infiltrate “hardened networks,” notably government systems and critical infrastructure facilities “of strategic interest to China,” as recently as November 2021. Symantec assessed that Daxin was “the most advanced piece of malware” developed by a China-linked actor to date. The malware had similar features to cyber tools used by Western intelligence and allowed the attackers to “burrow deep into a target’s network and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.” Symantec researchers are working alongside the U.S. Cyber Security and Infrastructure Agency, as well as engaging with impacted foreign governments, to detect and remediate the effects of the malware.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Beginning in September 2021, the MSS agent hired a private investigator to uncover or manufacture derogatory information about the candidate, saying “Whatever price is fine” and “Right now we don’t want him to be elected.” Eventually the agent proposed that the investigator physically attack the candidate or orchestrate a car accident to prevent his candidacy. While the Justice Department refused to name the candidate, details provided in a press release match those of Yan Xiong, a 2022 candidate for New York’s first congressional district. Xiong led a student protest in Tiananmen Square in 1989, became a naturalized U.S. citizen and served in the U.S. Army.

Attempts to infiltrate the systems were initially thwarted by cybersecurity firm Mandiant. However, the group persevered and used a vulnerability in USAHerds, a commercial software used by state governments for agricultural tracking purposes, to eventually break in. While at least 18 state agencies employed the software, Mandiant assessed that only three states had their systems breached. The cyber-campaign escalated further with the disclosure of a vulnerability in the popular Log4j logging tool in December 2021. The campaign was still ongoing as of March 2022, with Mandiant finding that two more state systems were breached at the end of February 2022. APT41 has been tied to China’s Ministry of State Security by U.S. Intelligence officials and has historically performed state-sponsored and financially motivated cyberattacks.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Other journalists who write about China had similar experiences and posted them to Allen Ebrahimian’s Twitter thread. LinkedIn has reached out to affected journalists and promised to minimize the impact of the block on the condition that journalists update or revise some of their posted content. LinkedIn responded to news outlet inquiries by defending their position as a company that respects the laws of every country they operate in.

While the information manipulation campaign was spread across 30 social media platforms, over 40 websites, and translated into 7 languages, the analysts believe that its main aim was to physically mobilize protestors in the United States. The campaign’s narratives, claiming for instance that COVID was engineered in Maryland research lab, mirrored similar claims by the Chinese government, leading U.S. officials to believe that the campaign was somehow connected to Beijing. In addition to spreading fallacies on COVID, the campaign also called on Asian-Americans to protest against racism in the United States. The operation was identified as following on from 2019 efforts to discredit Hong Kong protests in English and Chinese. John Hultquist, vice-president of intelligence analysis at FireEye, noted an improvement in the quality of video and subtitles. These improvements could point to long-term investment into information manipulation campaigns and into China’s ability to produce more convincing manipulations in the future.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The researchers identified unusual and coordinated pro-Russia comment activity on the websites of 32 major news outlets, including the BBC, Washington Post, and Fox News. These comments often originated from inauthentic or suspicious accounts. Russian state news routinely selected those comments and used them to make generalizations about public opinion in Western countries. Comments were used as the basis for headlines such as, “The British have compared the rise of Taliban to power with the end of Western civilization.” Cardiff University’s researchers discovered 242 incidents of such comments being fed into Russian media outlets. This tactic has been in use and escalating since 2018.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

After accessing Cyprus’ system, the cyber-unit was able to connect to the European Union’s internal exchange databases and access reports from the EU’s external missions, as well as the descriptions of visits to non-European countries, as well as accounts of meetings between European officials and other leaders. In addition to accessing the EU’s diplomatic cables, the cybercampaign also targeted the United Nations as well as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.</p>",

APT20 gained access to the systems of organizations in sectors such as energy, health care and aviation. Fox-IT found that the hacker group had obtained VPN credentials, on occasion bypassing the two-factor authentication (2FA) protection meant to prevent such credential theft and used the VPN accounts as backdoors into the victims’ networks. The cyber security firm found traces of Chinese language settings in the attack and determined that the attackers were most active during the habitual working hours of the China standard time time zone. Based on the techniques and tools used by the group, they attributed the activity, with medium confidence, to Chinese threat actor APT20.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

While NAM stated that no data was compromised, Reuters reported that the hackers targeted information related to a meeting between President Trump and NAM President Jay Timmons ahead of potential trade talks between the United States and China. Reuters further reports that, under the Trump administration, NAM greatly influenced trade talks with Beijing and had close ties with the White House, helping American officials attend public events in manufacturing plants across the country.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The cyber campaign affected at least eight of the world’s biggest managed service providers, such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM. Examples of potential end targets for APT10 include Brazilian mining giant Vale who sells large quantities of its product to Chinese companies, biotech firm Sygenta who was bought by Chinese state-owned conglomerate ChemChina during the cybercampaign, and Swedish telecoms giant Ericsson who has been competing with Huawei over 5G networs. While “Cloud Hopper” mainly targeted corporate intellectual property, government agencies were also affected. APT10 stole personnel records of more than 100,000 people from the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Department of Justice indicted two Chinese hackers associated to APT10 in December 2018, among other things over their contribution to the Cloud Hopper campaign.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The hackers compromised news websites popular with the Uyghur diaspora. The compromised websites would infect visitors’ devices with malicious code, granting the hackers access to the victim’s email, passwords, or real-time location. Volexity’s report states that at least two Chinese APT groups, including one known as Evil Eye, were behind the operation. According to TechCrunch, sources familiar with the matter thought the attack was state-backed, likely by the Chinese government. Later in September 2019, the digital rights group Citizen Lab reported that Evil Eye had used similar tactics to target the Tibetan diaspora between November 2018 and May 2019.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

They attempted to gain access to the victims’ computers and phones by creating fake Facebook accounts, as well as websites and apps intended to appeal to a Uyghur audience. In some cases, the hackers created lookalike websites almost identical to legitimate news sites popular with Uyghurs. Facebook did not directly attribute the operation to the Chinese state but said that it was “well-resourced and persistent,” hinting at nation-state backing. In addition, Evil Eye’s long track-record of going after diaspora groups of interest to the CCP, notably Uyghurs and Tibetans, strongly suggests Chinese state involvement.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The SVR hacking group, known as APT 29, gained access to the email service, Constant Contact, to send emails that appeared to be a USAID special alert about new evidence of fraud in the 2020 election. The emails contained links to malware that would give the Russian operatives access to the recipient’s computer network. Targets included anti-corruption groups, research organizations investigating Russian disinformation, and entities outspoken about the Kremlin’s treatment of Russian activist Alexei Navalny, such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Most of the spear-phishing emails were blocked by threat detection systems, though some may have successfully reached their targets, Microsoft said.</p>",

People with Chinese phone numbers sign up to Weixin, while people with international phone numbers register to WeChat. The two Tencent apps are interoperable but use different servers and store user data in different locations. However, Weixin is ubiquitous in China, meaning that Chinese Americans who are banned from WeChat risk losing contact with their friends and relatives in China. So while Tencent argues that only Weixin users inside China are subjected to Chinese law, WeChat users abroad are de facto subjected to Chinese censorship if they want to keep in touch with friends and family.</p>",

A statement by Zoom explained that the suspension took place in response to a demand from Chinese authorities, who deemed the meetings illegal under Chinese law. According to the Guardian, the company also suggested it would block any further meetings that Beijing deemed illegal.</p>",

The New York Times reported that the hacking campaign coincided with the release of a report, authored by the newspaper’s Shanghai bureau chief, exposing the wealth of then Chinese premier Wen Jiabao. The Chinese government had warned that the New York Times’ report would “have consequences.” Cybersecurity experts that helped the newspaper found that the attacks had been routed through American university computers previously used by the Chinese military “to attack United States military contractors.”</p>",

Microsoft said the hacking took advantage of a previously undetected vulnerability to remotely enter the email boxes. Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Centre blamed the cyber-attack on Hafnium, a state-sponsored group operating out of China.

In an evolution of tactics first employed to influence the 2016 election, the site's organizers appears to have paid genuine journalists to write stories fitting their narratives of social disruption and political polarization. Contributers reportedly received $50 to $75 per article, with the money transferred online. NAEBC staff also reportedly provided detailed instructions for the articles they commissioned and how they should be framed. Twitter and LinkedIn accounts have activity associated with NAEBC dating from June 2020, though content reportedly generated greater traction on Parler and Gab. U.S. government officials and civil society researchers assess the NAEBC setup as a new method by which Russian actors attempted to influence the U.S. electoral process.",

While the Chinese government denied the claim, and Silver stated that Morey would not be fired, the tweet did spark backlash against the NBA by Chinese companies and state media. The New York Times reports that several companies based in China cut ties with the Rockets, the most popular team in the country, and that the Beijing-controlled China Central Television network canceled its broadcasts of NBA games. The league was additionally criticized by American government officials as being too beholden to Beijing after it released an initial statement expressing regret over Morey's tweet. 10% of the NBA's 2019 revenue originates from the Chinese market, and according to CNN, that revenue could grow to 20% by 2030.",

Nearly half of internet email servers run Exim, a software that runs on Linux-based email servers to deliver emails from senders to recipients. The vulnerability was initially discovered in June 2019 and Microsoft issued an advisory to Azure customers a few weeks later, but as of May 1, 2020, half of these Exim servers were still operating on a version that was vulnerable to attack. The NSA advisory explains Sandworm’s exploitation as \"any attacker’s dream access,\" as the vulnerability has allowed hackers to remotely execute commands and code of their choosing.",

Jawdat, along with three other Uyghur men and women, met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in March 2019 to discuss Beijing's mass surveillance campaign targeting Uyghur Muslims. Jawdat's mother, aunt, and uncle had all been sent to internment camps in 2018, which the Chinese government says are used for vocational and educational purposes. After the meeting, Jawdat learned that his aunt and uncle had been transferred to another camp for a term of eight years, which he says was done in retaliation for his public advocacy. According to Buzzfeed, Pompeo made an apparent reference to the retaliatory jailing in an interview with Fox Business, saying \"this is the kind of thing [Chinese officials] do to impact [Jawdat's] behavior here in America. It's unacceptable\". It is estimated that more than a million Uyghurs and other Turkic ethnic groups are being held in internment camps.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The charges accused Huawei for engaging in a decade-long fraudulent financial scheme through a subsidiary from Iran, called Skycom. The investigators claimed that when finding about the investigation, Huawei tried to \"move witnesses with knowledge about Huawei’s Iran-based business to the PRC.\" As part of the proceedings, Huawei's chief financial officer was arrested in Canada in December 2018 at the request of the United States. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.",

Foreign National-1 also funded a marijuana startup that never came to fruition, leading some investigative journalists to suggest that it may be Andrey Muraview. In some cases, when Parnas and Fruman wanted to conceal the true source of their political donations, they incorporated an anonymous shell company called Global Energy Producers LLC (GEP), which had \"no income or significant assets.\"   While they made some donations directly in their own names, they falsely identified GEP as the contributor for some other donations (including the $325,000 contribution to America First Action on May 17, 2018), when in fact \"the funds came from a private lending transaction between Fruman and third parties, and never passed through a GEP account.\"",

According to ThinkProgress, several of the Instagram accounts were targeted at American citizens on both sides of the political spectrum. Other accounts targeted minority groups, social movements, and celebrity fan groups. According to ThinkProgress, many of the accounts were established in 2017, and some had gained followings in the tens of thousands (with one account garnering over 100,000 followers).

According to the court, the operation conducted by Taiwanese engineers was backed by the PRC government, and the information stolen was shared with a government-backed Chinese company. The district court in Taiching fined UMC $3.4 million, with the engineers jailed for periods between four to seven years. In November 2018, the U.S Department of Justice had already indicted UMC, the Chinese state-backed company and three engineers for conspiring to steal trade secrets from Micron. The FBI’s evidence was used by the Taiwanese court when issuing their sentence. According to the U.S. investigators, the PRC-state owned company was able to jumpstart China’s dynamic random-access memory industry thanks to Chinese espionage in the United States.",

Thousands of those tweets concerned Israel, with the majority supporting U.S. President Donald Trump’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and criticizing former U.S. President Barack Obama. However, some tweets were critical of Mr. Netanyahu. The accounts intended to influence the conversation about Israel in the United States rather than in Israel itself.

Removing the Resisters page resulted in removing an event, ‘No Unite the Right 2 DC’, which the page had created and recruited five unwitting legitimate grassroots organizations to co-host. The event was a counter protest to the Unite the Right 2 protest scheduled for August 10-12. According to the Washington Post, the removal launched a heated debate about freedom of speech and how to combat Russian government disinformation campaigns without censoring legitimate organizations and viewpoints. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, “a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

An April 2019 letter sent by the Civil Aviation Administration of China to foreign airlines called for website changes if Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan were categorized as countries. The letter cited a series of penalties to be implemented if the carriers did not make the desired changes, and several airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa, and Qantas, chose to comply. After the letter's release, the White House described the demands as \"Orwellian nonsense\". According to the New York Times, China is on course to becoming the largest global aviation market, with American companies vying to gain footholds. American, Delta, and United all own stakes in Chinese-based carriers.",

According to the report, \"more than four percent of all IRA tweets were related to energy or environmental issues,\" with accounts targeting \"pipelines, fossil fuels, climate change, and other divisive issues to influence public policy.\" In January 2017, the U.S. intelligence community similarly exposed efforts by Russian state-sponsored media outlets to influence U.S. energy policy through anti-fracking programming. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, “a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.",

The journalist had reported from Taiwan and had covered issues including Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, repression of Uighurs and Tibetans, and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on news outlets and the internet. After the journalist's remarks, the Chinese co-director of the Confucius Institute criticized her for discussing negative developments in China rather than emphasizing positive stories. The co-director had told university officials she would boycott the event unless the Taiwan references were removed from the speaker's biography. Confucius Institutes are language and culture centers run by the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Education, which are hosted in more than 500 universities around the world. Critics have raised concerns about incidents of infringement upon intellectual freedom at some Confucius Institutes, whose terms of agreement are often hidden. A former head of propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party has called them \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.",

On June 2, Sputnik published another \"conspiratorial\" piece featuring fringe allegations that \"Rich's death could have been part of a massive conspiracy\" to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016. Later reporting revealed that Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers manipulated metadata in stolen DNC files before releasing them, in order to corroborate the conspiracy theory.",

During this round of social media influence, the IRA used heightened techniques to avoid detection, including VPNs, internet phone services, paying third parties to run the ads, and paying for the ads in U.S. and Canadian dollars. The ads played mostly on racial and political divides in the United States, including ads targeting African Americans and Native Americans, as well as anti-Trump ads. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, “a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.",

Among other subjects, trolls from the IRA have seized on the Roseanne Barr controversy, the NFL #TakeAKnee debate, the #MeToo movement, and the Trump administration, often playing both sides of the issues to inflame discourse. The IRA has also targeted specific politicians and media outlets, including Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, John McCain, and CNN. To direct its operations, the IRA provides its workers with specific instructions on how to target narratives toward particular audiences and minority groups, even specifying the best times of day for social media activity. The IRA also uses inauthentic accounts posing as American citizens to communicate with activists and promote protests. One such IRA Twitter account, @wokeluisa, gained over 55,000 followers after its creation in March 2017. The account was erroneously cited numerous times by major U.S. media outlets, lending it further reach and legitimacy. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, “a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.",

Early on November 9, #Calexit was among Twitter's top hashtags, in part thanks to IRA trolls. In the past, Yes California, a pro-secessionist group, has received substantial positive press and coverage from Kremlin state-controlled media outlets. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, “a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.",

The trolls employed fake email accounts, Facebook ads, Facebook events, and inauthentic Instagram accounts to promote the events. According to The New York Times, the efforts included organizing the rallies, coordinating with grassroots efforts, soliciting promotion from activists, requesting rally signs directly from campaigns, and monetarily supporting protests. The rallies spanned the political spectrum and focused on divisive issues, such as race and immigration. In some cases, the IRA organized both protests and corresponding counter protests with the goal of stoking anger and confrontation. Beyond organizing the rallies, IRA social media accounts also contributed by funding advertising, flyers, and rally supplies. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, “a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.",

Federal authorities initially identified 21 states that had been probed ahead of the election, though post-election investigations revealed more widespread efforts. Hackers successfully gained access to election infrastructure systems and extracted voter data in two states, which were publicly identified as Illinois and Arizona. Hackers also gained access to the networks of a Florida county government through a spearphishing campaign targeting election officials in that state. Both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the U.S. Intelligence Community reported that the hackers did not gain access to any systems involved in vote tallying. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

            "content": "<p>In 2015, a Russian gun enthusiast and aspiring foreign agent named Maria Butina pitched an espionage proposal to Alexander Torshin, who is a senior Russian government official and close Putin ally: Because official diplomatic channels under the Obama administration were not succeeding at altering U.S. foreign policy, Russia should instead pursue the same objectives via a back channel that Torshin and Butina would develop through the NRA to the Republican party and a future Trump administration. Torshin agreed and funded the secret operation. Butina brought into the conspiracy a longtime Republican operative she was dating named Paul Erickson. She met one presidential candidate at an NRA convention, used her FSB connections to facilitate a trip to Moscow meant to cultivate top NRA officials, hosted multiple large \"friendship dinners\" for prominent Republicans, publicly asked then-candidate Donald Trump a question about Russia sanctions at a 2015 rally, and brought a Russian delegation to the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast (where the Russians sought to establish the back channel and report back directly to Putin). Between 2012 and 2016, Torshin met every NRA president and attended all NRA annual meetings. At the 2016 annual meeting, Torshin was trying to arrange a Trump-Putin summit and met privately with Donald Trump Jr. In 2018, Butina was arrested and pled guilty to conspiring \"to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence in U.S. politics\" for the \"benefit of the Russian Federation.\" Separately, the FBI investigated whether Torshin funneled secret campaign donations to Trump through the National Rifle Association, but it's not clear what came of the inquiry, if anything, and the NRA was not mentioned in the unredacted Mueller report. Spanish authorities have sought to arrest Torshin as they consider him the investor atop an elaborate money laundering scheme. In 2016, the NRA spent triple the amount of money supporting Trump as it devoted to the 2012 election, with most of the money coming from the NRA's 501(c)(4) that doesn't have to disclose its donors. The NRA has said it only received $2,513 \"from people associated with Russian addresses\" or known Russian nationals living in the United States and that it didn't spend Russian-linked money on politics, but the NRA has not disclosed its donor identifies, methods of vetting shell companies, or systems of segregating foreign money.</p>",

Over the next few weeks, Facebook received substantial public, media, and governmental criticism over its perceived lack of transparency regarding the manipulation of its platform, culminating in the release of over 3,000 Russian-linked ads to Congress. While some ads were targeted to support specific candidates, including Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein, other ads focused on specific hot-button issues such as immigration and racism. The IRA also used falsified American accounts to purchase at least $6,000 worth of ads on Instagram, including ads promoting Jill Stein and “Florida Goes Trump” rallies.

In July 2015, hackers from Russian intelligence-connected Cozy Bear, or APT29, infiltrated the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) computer network using spear phishing tactics. According to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, the hackers \"monitor[ed] the DNC’s email and chat communications.\" A January 2017 report from the Director of National Intelligence states that Cozy Bear \"maintained that access until at least June 2016.\" On March 19, 2016, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta opened a phishing email disguised as a Google security alert, giving Russian military intelligence-connected Fancy Bear, or APT28, access to Podesta’s account and the Clinton campaign network. On April 6, 2016, Russian hackers successfully spear phished an employee of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Just days later, the hackers breached the DCCC, stealing thousands of pages of internal party documents. On April 18, 2016, Fancy Bear leveraged its DCCC access to further infiltrate the DNC. The GRU officers installed malware to steal data, such as opposition research, from the DNC. By June, the hackers had compromised 33 DNC computers. In January 2017, U.S. intelligence officials revealed that Russian hackers also accessed Republican computer systems prior to the 2016 election, including old Republican National Committee domains that were no longer in use. However, the hackers elected not to leak most of the documents belonging to Republican lawmakers. The revelation indicates that Russian actors targeted both major American political parties in their attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, but primarily released Democrats' documents.",

By May, \"the [IRA's] strategy included interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with the stated goal of 'spread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.'\" The IRA received funding for its interference operations from companies tied to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin insider known as \"Putin's chef.\" Russian trolls created accounts impersonating Americans to influence domestic American debate over divisive issues, such as energy and climate policy, race, gun control, LGBT issues, and immigration, as well as to drum up support for candidates, including Jill Stein, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders. The IRA also published and amplified derogatory information targeted at candidates, including Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, throughout the presidential and primary campaigns. The IRA funded political advertisements, related expenses such as “buttons, flags, and banners for rallies,” as well as rally leaders (usually Americans) through PayPal accounts and occasionally through use of cryptocurrency. The IRA also purchased false identification documents to create accounts at PayPal and online cryptocurrency exchanges. Since the election, Facebook alone has found over 470 accounts, which generated 80,000 posts reaching as many as 126 million Americans. The IRA also infiltrated Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, and the meme site 9Gag.",

The call prompted significant backlash from Nuland’s European counterparts over her critical commentary regarding European involvement in Ukrainian politics. The White House and the State Department attributed the leak to the Russian government.",

Hacker group APT 41 features particularly prominently in the report, having conducted several cyber-attacks against various American healthcare actors between 2013 and 2018. In addition, a FireEye blog post explained that, over the course of several years, APT41 targeted a variety of U.S. industries such as healthcare, high-tech, higher education or telecommunications. The blog post also posits that Chinese authorities turn a blind eye to the group’s for-profit cyber-activities against videogame companies in exchange for their cooperation on operations in the state's interests.",

The targeting of Linux systems was particularly noteworthy because the platform \"runs nearly all of the top 1 million websites online, 75% of all web servers, 98% of the world’s supercomputers and 75% of major cloud service providers.\" The researchers highlighted that a key factor behind the operation’s success was the fact that the five APT groups were composed of Chinese civilian sub-contractors who worked collaboratively among themselves, as well as with their government counterparts. BlackBerry tied the launch of the report to the U.S. Department of Justice’s announcement of \"several high-profile indictments from over 1,000 open FBI investigations into economic espionage.\"",

DHS, which published a warning in 2014 that the attacks had compromised \"numerous industrial control systems environments,\" reported that the hackers used a variant of the BlackEnergy malware, which Russian government-linked hackers previously used to target critical infrastructure in Ukraine. Analysts attributed the attacks to a group linked to Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU). The hacking campaign reportedly affected over 1,000 organizations in over 84 countries.

The U.S. sanctioned Russian officials responsible for the killing through the Magnitsky Act in 2012. In retaliation, the Kremlin banned Americans from adopting Russian orphans. In 2015, the U.S. Justice Department was prosecuting a company owned by Russian businessman Denis Katsyv as a beneficiary of some of the stolen $230 million, which had allegedly been laundered and invested in New York real estate. Katsyv sought help from U.S. lawyers and lobbyists, who recommended setting up a non-profit foundation in Delaware. They called it the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, purportedly for American families wanting to adopt Russian orphans. By legally organizing as a U.S. nonprofit, the foundation effectively concealed its sources of funding, which if revealed might have required registering as a foreign agent. The $500,000 of contributions turned out to have come from Katsyv and other Moscow elites asked to support him. The foundation held an account at Bank of America, which alerted the U.S. Treasury after investigating and suspecting that the transaction activity was evidence of corruption and bribery in Russia's bid to overturn the Magnitsky Act. The influence operation employed lobbyists and consultants led by Natalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer who was later indicted in a related case proving her ties to the Kremlin. Non-profits have similarly been used in other countries such as Canada to lobby against Russia sanctions.",

Researchers targeted by these programs often continue their work outside of China, remunerated by their institution, supplemented by Chinese payments. By employing scientists in laboratories around the world, the CCP benefits from the structural, financial, and technological resources of those laboratories. However, host institutions’ ignorance of these programs means that they are unwittingly using their resources to fund a foreign government. Additionally, the CCP’s emphasis acquiring dual use technology, means that much of the research conducted in institutions abroad is eventually used by the PLA or enables the repression of minorities in China. Many of the talent recruitment agencies also work with the United Front and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology’s State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs. China uses \"United Front\" work to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP’s United Front Work Department (UFWD)—the agency responsible for coordinating these kinds of influence operations—mostly focuses on the management of potential opposition groups inside China, but it also has an important foreign influence mission.",

According to the court documents, the hackers of APT10 group compromised dozens of computer systems and stole sensitive information from more than 100,000 Navy personnel. This intrusion was part of the ‘Cloud Hopper’ campaign during which APT10 hacked into at least eight of the world’s biggest technology service providers, such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM, gaining unfettered access to their clients' data.</p>",

Investigators discovered that he had been preparing a bomb intended for a Bricorama store, aiming to cause property damage without casualties. The individual, identified as originating from the Donbass region and having previously fought with pro-Russian separatists, was charged with participation in a terrorist criminal association and possession of explosives in connection with a terrorist enterprise. French authorities suspect that he was acting under foreign direction, with communications on encrypted messaging platforms suggesting coordination from abroad.

The subsequent investigation revealed that the graffiti was part of a Russian destabilization attempt to raise tensions between the large Jewish and Muslim communities in the city. The French governmental agency Viginum, which is tasked with monitoring foreign information manipulation attempts, found that bots affiliated with the Russian network <em>Doppelganger </em>were using the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to fuel controversy regarding the paintings. In February 2024, France’s domestic intelligence agency assessed that the FSB’s fifth division that focuses on international operations was behind the destabilization attempt. Media reports also commented that the operation echoed a 1950s KGB operation that posted antisemitic slogans and swastikas throughout West Germany to mimic Nazi sentiment.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The campaign aimed at discrediting governments, public officials, media and fact-checking agencies in more than 60 countries, France being a “prime target”. Propagated narratives criticized French support for Ukraine, specific French political figures, and the 2024 Paris Olympics. The campaign posted deepfake content, reports and images on online platforms, primarily on X, in the comment section of public figures, media outlets and fact-checking sites. Matrioshka operators then asked those influential accounts to investigate their false claims. Most content was traced back to Russian-language Telegram channels. Viginum assessed that “the criteria for foreign digital interference have been satisfied”.</p>",

The network originally covered Russian and Ukrainian news for Russian-speaking audiences, but shifted its focus to Ukrainian and Western audiences, particularly in France, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They did not produce any original content but rather used automation and search engine optimization to amplify posts from pro-Russian public figures in Europe, Russian news agencies, and official communications of the Russian government. Portal Kombat promoted false or misleading information about Russia’s war in Ukraine, denigrated Ukrainian leadership, and criticized Western governments supporting Kyiv. The Viginum report highlighted the central role of Crimea-based, Russian web development company TigerWeb in the creation and administration of the network sites. According to Viginum, Portal Kombat met “the criteria for foreign digital interference” and shared significant technical similarities to the Inforos network, which is under EU sanctions and assessed by the United States to be under GRU administration.</p>",

According to the agency, accounts linked to the PRC disseminated accusations that Glucksman was a trojan horse for the CIA in Europe, a rumor that had previously circulated in French far-right and -left circles. The PRC had issued sanctions against Glucksmann in 2021 for his vocal and repeated criticism of the PRC’s treatment towards Uyghurs.

In the first campaign, Storm-1679 created a faux Netflix documentary, narrated by an AI-generated Tom Cruise voice and titled “Olympics Has Fallen”, which they promoted across social media using AI-edited <em>Cameo</em> videos of American celebrities delivering anti-Ukraine messages and encouraging viewers to watch the documentary. Both Storm-1679 and Storm-1099’s main disinformation tactic, however, was to replicate reputable media outlets and democratic governments to disseminate Kremlin-talking points under the guise of authoritative sources. In one case, Storm-1679 released press releases supposedly emanating from the CIA and French General Directorate for Internal Security discouraging people from attending the Olympics, citing terrorist attack concerns. Similarly, Storm-1099’s versions of French outlets <em>Le Parisien</em> and <em>Le Point</em> propagated criticisms against Macron’s “showmanship” and his disregard of socio-economic issues in France.</p>",

The French outlets Le Monde and Le Figaro had their websites spoofed. The French Foreign Ministry also had its website impersonated and used to spread false information. In particular, VIGINUM, the French agency responsible for fighting online interference, said the fake websites were designed to sow confusion about Paris’s support for Ukraine. VIGINUM identified more than 350 fake domains targeting countries around Europe. The French agency assessed that the network of false websites was connected to a sprawling Russian disinformation campaign that Meta identified in 2022 but which continues to push false content.   </span></div>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The French politicians, Thierry Mariani, from the National Rally Party, and Yves Pozzo di Borgo, former Senator and Paris counsellor, are the most active members of the association and have repeatedly defended the Kremlin’s foreign policy. The association is one of the most influential Russian political relays in France and seeks to deepen cooperation between politicians and businessmen from both countries. The French Ministry of Economy’s anti-money laundering unit identified suspicious financial transactions that transited through YPDB Conseil, a consulting company created by Pozzo di Borgo a few weeks after his 2017 Senate departure. According to the trade register, this company grew exponentially in 2018 and 2020, which granted the French politician generous dividends worth 103,838 euros in 2020. The Ministry’s investigations showed that YPDB Conseil made 85% of its turnover with the Russian bus manufacturer Bakulin Motors Group, believed to be connected to a Kremlin-linked oligarch.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

APT31 also operates under the aliases Zirconium and Judgment Panda and specializes in the theft of highly competitive organizations’ intellectual property. While the effected institutions were not named, ANSSI noted that the campaign utilized “a network of compromised home routers as operational relay boxes” to conduct reconnaissance and attacks. A December update of the ANSSI alert notes that, while the attack is still ongoing, APT31 has ceased its use of infected home routers.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

A “Spanish-speaking man originally from South America” poured gasoline on three buses and lit it up, causing an estimated 200,000 Czech crowns (USD $8,738) in damages, before depot employees extinguished the fire. The man had been in the country five days prior to his arrest. CCTV footage showed a dark-haired man assumed to be the suspect purchasing materials at a gas-station and information found on his mobile phone incriminated him. Czech police arrested and held him on terrorism charges. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 20-30 years in prison. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan warned of possible similar attacks in other European cities following the attempted arson.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Russian diplomats accused the Czech Republic of lying and circulated alternative theories about the explosion, including that the Czech claim was meant to distract international attention from a U.S. plot to overthrow Alexander Lukashenko’s regime in Belarus, where domestic protests were pressuring Lukashenko to step down. Russian officials also questioned the motives behind the Czech accusation, arguing it might have been a political move designed to rally the public ahead of parliamentary elections in the country.

Médea commissions and allots advertising revenue for several Czech news outlets; Washington DC-based think tank RWR Advisory reports that the acquisition grants CITIC \"considerable influence over the Czech Republic's media landscape\". CITIC first gained a minority share in Médea in 2018, when the investment group assumed control of Czech assets previously owned by troubled Chinese firm CEFC Energy. CITIC acquired CEFC's 31% share in Médea, and brokered an equity increase to 57% through its Czech investing arm Rainbow Wisdom. According to an anonymous source quoted by Czech investigative news site HlídacíPes, CITIC's majority control is expected to entail that a fund of $119 million, managed by Médea, is divided amongst news outlets with, outlets publishing stories favorable to China accounts to be allocated greater shares of advertising revenue. The deal was reportedly facilitated by former Czech Defense Minister Jaroslav Tvrdik, and Jan Hamacek, current advisor to President Milos Zeman.",

The report explained that excluding Huawei from the country's 5G rollout would dramatically increase costs. The report concluded that \"building 5G without Huawei\" would cost the country \"12 to 38 billion crowns\" or $500 million to $1 billion. CETA's analysis further alleged that construction of 5G networks in the Czech Republic would slow because Huawei's competitors lack equivalent production capacity, and that this delay would affect the wider Czech economy. The investigation by Aktuálnê revealed that the numbers referenced by CETA originated from an Oxford Economics report that estimated the cost of excluding Huawei from 5G networks in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. According to Aktuálnê, CETA extrapolated Oxford Economics' numbers without collecting its own empirical data. The CETA report comes amidst repeated warnings by Czech intelligence agencies about the security risk implicit in relying on Huawei technology within the country's critical infrastructure. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.",

The $2.1bn purchase of CME by PPF Group has caused public concern, including that of United States Senator Marco Rubio, due to the investment firm's business operations in China. PPF's ties to Chinese authorities were strengthened in 2014, when a financial institution owned by PPF, Home Credit, was given the first foreign license to deal in China's domestic loans market. Following the announcement of CME's acquisition by PPF, Senator Rubio wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Attorney General William Barr in which he explained that PPF was the Chinese state's \"proxy inside the Czech Republic\".",

In 2019, Prague withdrew from a partnership agreement with Beijing over the agreement's reference to the one China policy, which recognizes Taiwan as part of PRC territory. A week prior to the announcement about the flight cancellations, Prague signed an agreement with Taiwanese capital Taipei, and Shanghai severed official contact with the city in retaliation. Hainan had been operating three direct flights between Beijing and Prague since 2015. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zuzana Stichova said that the Czech government doesn't know \"whether this is a temporary or definitive decision and whether this step is commercially or politically motivated\".",

Prague's decision to enter into a partnership with Taiwan, and Shanghai's response, is one development amidst an ongoing dispute between the Czech city and Beijing over the one China policy. Prague leadership voted in 2019 to withdraw from a sister-city agreement with Beijing after Chinese officials declined to remove a clause that would have required Prague to commit to the policy, which considers Taiwan a part of PRC territory. According to Reuters, Prague's city council members said the inclusion of the clause was unusual for city-to-city agreements, given that the diplomatic matters are typically addressed by national governments. Czech President Milos Zeman expressed support for the policy in a personal letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping following the withdrawal, writing that \"the Czech Republic, its government, fully respects the policy of one China\". In a press release announcing Prague's partnership with Taipei, Czech lawmaker Jan Cizinsky remarked that \"sister contracts should never be subject to extortion or threats\".",

The letter referenced the extent of Czech businesses operating within China, such as credit company Home Credit and Volkswagen subsidiary Škoda Auto; according to Czech news outlet Aktuálnê, China acts as the largest global market for Škoda car sales, and Home Credit has administered approximately $13 billion in consumer loans within China. The letter further warned that the visit by Kubera, who passed away before the visit was set to occur in February 2020, would violate the Chinese regime's one-China policy recognizing Beijing's sovereignty over Taiwan. Reuters reports that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis' government has repeatedly stressed that it adheres to the one-China policy.</p>",

The regime granted the firm the first foreign license to provide domestic loans to consumers in China in 2014, and has since retained close links with Beijing.

Prague's city council voted to cancel its sister-city agreement with Beijing, originally signed in 2016 prior to a visit to Prague by Chinese president Xi Jinping, after it failed to remove a clause pledging a commitment to the \"one China\" policy. The policy stipulates that Taiwan remains a part of the Chinese state, and recognizes Beijing as its sole representative. The cancellation of the Prague Philharmonic's visit to China comes after the city's Chinese embassy released a statement on its Facebook page urging Prague officials to reconsider, otherwise \"it will eventually hurt its own interests\". The orchestra incurred a loss of \"several million Czech crowns\" according to its director Radim Otepka.",

Two former managers previously employed at Huawei's Czech branch told Czech Radio's investigative arm, Radiožurnál, that the data was gathered during meetings with clients, and then entered into an internal database to which Huawei's China headquarters have access. They also allege that the information was commonly discussed with Chinese embassy employees. According to press reports, the information collected by Huawei ranged from how many children a client had, to the person's financial circumstances. According to Radiožurnál, Czech intelligence officials are aware of this practice, and regularly conduct trainings for civil servants and politicians on how to combat information gathering tactics. Ladislav Šticha, spokesman for Czech intelligence agency BIS, stated that the agency warns meeting and conference attendees that \"anything they say can be recorded and passed on to a foreign power\". Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.",

While the agency's warning did not constitute a ban, it legally required 160 operators of critical infrastructure in the Czech Republic to begin risk analyses and act in accordance with their findings. As a result of the warning, Huawei was excluded from a Czech tender to build a new online tax portal. The warning also calls into question a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between Huawei and Czech investment company PPF Group, which controls a number of Eastern European telecom operators, to begin testing 5G networks across the region.

The Ministry delegated the oversight of daily operations to the Mixed Czech-China Mutual Cooperation Chamber, a private association run Jaroslav Tvrdík. Tvrdík, former defense minister and personal adviser to Czech President Milos Zeman, is a board member of CITIC Europe. CITIC, operated by the Chinese state, acquired the Czech assets once belonging to investment group CEFC in 2018, where Tvrdík also held a position as board chairman. CEFC was a prominent investor in the Czech Republic, purchasing a wide array of assets in 2015 and 2016 which it then sold to CITIC after encountering financial difficulties. Tvrdík's Czech-China Cooperation Chamber is an example of PRC friendship associations which are considered \"pillars of the global influence apparatus that employ United Front tactics to systematically advance\" CCP interests abroad, such as the BRI agenda, according to Czech think tank Sinopsis.",

Although classified data was stored separately and not accessed, the hackers obtained emails involving prosecutors, police, and political offices, as well as personal information about VSSE personnel. The attack was attributed to Chinese threat actor UNC4841, which used at least three strains of malware to gain access.

While claiming to “protect compatriots against global Russophobia”, Pravfond financed the propaganda websites Golos which targeted the Ukrainian public, and Euromore which addressed Russian-speaking audiences in Europe. Both repeated Russian narratives about Ukraine as a corrupt and fascist state and claimed to promote traditional values. Pravfond also provided legal defense for suspected Russian intelligence agents operating in Europe, including arms trafficker Victor Bout and assassin Vadim Krasikov. Media reported that Pravfond and Russia’s military intelligence service GRU were connected. For example, the organization’s staff included former intelligence officers like Vladimir Pozdorovkin. The organization’s director Aleksandr Udaltsov was sanctioned by the EU in 2023 for “undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine”. Even though the fund has existed since 2012, its activities increased dramatically following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>",

They sent out 1,000 emails to 400 accounts intending to gather data on members’ internet activities for more targeted cyberattacks in the future. The United Kingdom and United States reacted with sanctions and legal action against the group. Those affected were not informed of the hack, nor its connection to the PRC until March 25, 2024, two months after the publication of an indictment against APT31 hackers by the US Department of Justice. IPAC and its members have since requested the launch of official investigations, pressured their respective governments and the EU to establish legal frameworks to prevent such opacity in the future, called on them to join the United Kingdom and United States in sanctioning APT31, and demanded to strengthen cyber security for politicians.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

One week before the elections, researchers from <em>AI Forensics</em> and the Finnish software company <em>Check First</em> added that in the month of May alone, 275 anti-EU and anti-Ukraine political ads reached over 3 million Facebook users in France, Germany, Poland, and Italy.</p>",

The website allegedly paid right-wing and Euroskeptic politicians in several EU countries—including Germany, France, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary—to spread anti-Ukraine sentiment and influence the June elections. Pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk was allegedly behind the network. On May 17, 2024, the Council of the European Union announced the suspension of all broadcasting activities by Voice of Europe as well as by three other Russian state-affiliated media companies -- RIA Novosti, Izvestia, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The EU accused these outlets of conducting information manipulation with regards to the war in Ukraine and of targeting political parties during electoral cycles, Russian ethnic minorities, and gender minorities.</p>",

In their message exchange, Woo also told Creyelman that the PRC intended to “divide the US-EU relationship”. The messages also contained evidence of payments from Woo to Creyelman. In response to these revelations, the Belgian Prime Minister called the PRC “sometimes very hostile” and Creyelman was kicked out of his party, the Vlaams Belang. Creyelman’s brother, Steve, a member of the Belgian Federal Parliament, also had to step down from his position as chair of the Military Purchases Committee after media revealed that he at least knew about his brother’s dealings with the PRC. The case also exposed a gap in Belgian legislation as, as of December 2023, there were no offenses under which the conduct of the Creyelman brothers or the Chinese handler could be prosecuted.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Its goal was to direct real people on Telegram to flood platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram with pro-Russian comments and posts. This organized trolling campaign targeted posts by public figures, journalists, politicians, and celebrities. Meta claimed it first detected Cyber Front Z’s physical troll farm, operating out St. Petersburg, one month after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It banned the group from its platforms in April and shut down 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts associated with it. Meta officials argued that Cyber Front Z’s efforts were unsuccessful and described them as “clumsy and largely ineffective”. Additionally, the UK government linked Cyber Front Z to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Internet Research Agency.    </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The attacks on the Interior Ministry were attributed to APT 27, APT 30 and APT 31 while the cyber operations targeting the Belgian Defense involved hacker groups UNC 2814, GALLIUM, and SOFTCELL. According to The Brussels Times, the attacks against the Ministry of Interior granted Chinese hackers access to the institution’s networks for two years. In addition, Belgium’s Cybersecurity Center suggested that the attacks against the Interior Ministry bore the marks of an intelligence gathering operation. The media also reported that the Ministry of Defence attacks took place in 2021 and resulted in the institution’s network being cut off from the internet for weeks with its staff unable to communicate via email.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Google and cybersecurity firm Proofpoint identified Mustang Panda and RedDelta — two interrelated cyber threat actors backed by the Chinese state —as the senders of phishing emails. RedDelta used a hacked email address of a diplomat from a European NATO member state to send such phishing emails to other countries’ diplomatic offices. These emails were embedded with tracking pixels and contained an attached malicious zip file entitled “Situation at the EU borders with Ukraine.zip.” The zip file’s name sought to capitalize on the anticipated refugee crisis driven by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. If opened, the zip file downloaded additional files while the tracking pixels signaled to the hackers that the user had opened the email and was more susceptible to future attack.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Fatih Birol, the IEA chief, argued that “Russia’s behavior” was a contributing factor to Europe’s energy crisis, which has led to increased gas prices and shortages. The Kremlin insists it is fulfilling its long-term gas supply contracts, but some European policymakers have asserted Moscow is intentionally worsening the continent’s energy challenges by limiting spot sales. Birol noted that Russian gas exports to Europe had decreased by 25 percent year-on-year in the final three months of 2021.  </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

According to <em>Spiegel</em>, over 270 vehicles were vandalized across Berlin, Brandenburg, Bavaria and Badden-Wurttemberg. Construction foam was found sprayed onto the vehicles’ exhaust pipes and, in an attempt to divert attention, the vandalizers placed ecological stickers on the cars to place blame on climate activist groups. Prosecutors from Ulm, a city in the South of Germany, identified four individuals including a German, a Serb, a Romanian and a Bosnian, as potential suspects. One of the suspects claimed that they had been promised about USD $104 per vandalized car by a Russian user over the <em>Viber</em> chat-app. Local authorities warned that Russian sabotage campaigns were likely to continue until the elections.</p>",

Sokolov had shot Khangoshvili in Berlin’s Kleiner Tiergarten in August 2019. In December 2019, the Bellingcat investigation team established that “Vadim Sokolov” was in fact Vadim Krasikov, an individual with ties to the FSB, Russia’s domestic security agency. Khangoshvili was a Georgian national and former Chechen rebel commander. He had been seeking asylum in Germany since 2016 under the name Tornike K, after Russian authorities had classified him as a terrorist. The German court found that the Russian state had ordered the killing, which constituted an act of “state terrorism”. Following the conviction of Krasikov, Germany’s Foreign Ministry announced the expulsion of two Russian diplomats from Germany in response to the murder.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Germany is the second largest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion and Rheinmetall plays a significant role in that military support. The German weapons’ manufacturer notably provides Leopard 1 main battle tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, and 155mm artillery shells to Kyiv. A month before the assassination attempt, it had opened an armored vehicle maintenance facility in the Western part of Ukraine.

However, the foundation also aimed to ensure the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, potentially circumventing US sanctions. The foundation was mostly funded by the Nord-Stream 2 AG, a Swiss company itself fully funded by Gazprom. Nord Stream 2 AG also participated in the drafting of the foundation’s charter.

One year later, the German weekly Der Spiegel reported additional details about the manifesto. They explained that, in July 2022, the Kremlin commissioned Tatyana Matveyeva, the deputy to the Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko, to draw up a new concept for AfD, aiming at boosting support for the party and reaching majorities at the local, regional, and federal level, notably through cooperation between the far-right and far-left. The documents suggested rebranding AfD under the name of “United Germany” or “German Unity” and promoting the end of discrimination against Russian Germans.</p>\r\n<p>Whether the document reached AfD is unclear. However, interviews with officials and affiliates from both AfD and the new far-left party BSW suggest that at least one member of each party has been in contact with Kremlin officials when the plans were being drawn up.</p>",

In the clip posted to Telegram and other platforms, four senior German military officers, including the chief of the German air force, discussed whether German Taurus cruise missiles would be capable of destroying the Kerch bridge connecting mainland Russia to occupied and illegally annexed Crimea. At the time, German Chancellor Scholz had repeatedly refused to deliver such missiles to Ukaine. The Kremlin used the recording to allege that Western powers were planning to strike Russian territory and place British troops in Ukraine. These claims caused panic in NATO countries, particularly in the UK. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius promised a swift investigation into the “very serious matter” of this “hybrid attack of disinformation”. The investigation concluded that a Russian spy had dialed into the Webex-call without being noticed due to “individual errors”.</p>",

Officials eventually attributed the attack to APT28, a hacking unit also known as Fancy Bear directed by Russia’s military intelligence service (GRU).

His unrestricted access to the German federal parliament and national legislation have been suspended. In August 2023, news outlets <em>Spiegel</em> and <em>The Insider</em> first reported on the incident, based on leaked conversations between Sergienko and an unknown person called ‘Alexei’. The conversations from March 2023 indicate that Sergienko was asking for Russian financial and media support to prepare a legal complaint against German military support for Ukraine, aiming to prevent or at least delay the delivery of arms and non-lethal goods. In April 2023, he also asked for a money transfer to a German NGO with pro-Kremlin positions. ‘Alexei’ was later identified as Ilya Vechtomov, an officer of the Fifth Service of Russia’s Federal Security Service. In July 2023, the AfD initiated legal procedure  <em>2 BvE 5/23</em>, in which it claimed the German Parliament had not been sufficiently involved and consulted in the executive’s decision to supply military equipment to Ukraine.</p>",

After the books had already been printed, the Chinese publisher requested that the German publisher make edits to portray the Cultural Revolution more favorably. They also asked that the book, which the Chinese foreword presents as based on the memories of someone the author met, be presented as fiction in the German translation. The German publisher refused the changes, resulting in the partial cancellation of the book tour. In a related story, Thalia, a large German bookstore chain, had its Chinese literature section emptied of content critical of the CCP. According to DW, Thalia’s shelves instead had “speeches by Xi Jinping front and center.” It turned out the displays were curated by a German subsidiary of China International Publishing Group.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

German intelligence agencies warned in July that the Russian hacking collective, known as Ghostwriter, was attempting to steal data from German officials, potentially to use in a hack-and-leak operation designed to disrupt the German elections. Days before the polls opened, the European Union’s top diplomat attributed Ghostwriter’s campaign to Russia and called the group’s actions a threat to “the core functioning of our democracies.” No significant hack-and-leak operation surfaced prior to Germany’s election.   </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

FireEye reports that UNC1151, a state-sponsored cyber actor that uses malware and credential theft tactics, is likely behind the attack. Additionally, FireEye concluded that the attack was a part of a broader influence campaign called Ghostwriter, which has involved attacks in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland since 2017 and is aligned with Russian security interests. Historically, the campaign has utilized fake email accounts and junk news sites to spread anti-NATO sentiment and false narratives.</p>",

Following the hearing, Emet received a phone call from his sister still living in the Chinese province of Xinjiang for the first time in three years. Towards the end of the call, a Chinese official warned Emet that he needed \"to think of [his] family while [he's] running around doing [his] activism work in Germany.\" Emet, who has lived in Germany for over two decades, volunteers for the World Uyghur Congress, a global organization of exiled Uyghurs that promotes \"democracy, human rights, and freedom\" for the Uyghur people. According to the Guardian, the warning made to Emet is part of a campaign by Beijing to quell criticism of the CCP policies that have led to the detainment of more than a million ethnic Uyghurs, and other Turkic Muslim minorities, within internment camps.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The \"China Reporter\" project, which never came to fruition, was conceptualized by Mr. Shi and two German journalists who he could trust \"to permanently influence the image of China in Germany and shape it more objectively\", as explained in the letter. The German reporters, Georg Blume of Die Zeit and Spiegel, and Wolfgang Hirn of Manager Magazine, had \"decades of experience in China and in the best German media\", again according to the letter. Mr. Shi estimated that the project would cost an annual budget of 250,000 euros, and he wrote to major German companies belonging to the DAX stock index asking for financial support. While the project was not successful, German news site Süddeutsche Zeitung reports that the letter gives insight into Beijing's efforts to influence public opinion in Germany.",

One document suggests the goal of the operation was to deliver to the Kremlin its \"own absolutely controlled MP in the Bundestag.\" A separate document obtained from an unnamed EU state intelligence agency detailed the overarching aim of Russian support for Frohnmaier - to see him take an influential role in shaping AfD foreign policy on the expectation that he would promote closer ties to Russia and insert Russian-friendly planks into the party platform. Since Frohnmaier's election in 2017, Russian state-sponsored media has featured the young parliamentarian prominently in its coverage, focusing heavily on his pro-Russian positions, including his public acceptance of Russia's annexation of Crimea and his personal validation of the 2018 Russian presidential election, which he deemed to be free and fair. German officials from across the political spectrum have called for Frohnmaier to resign.",

The agreement sets aside approximately 500,000 euros over a five-year period to fund a teaching degree in Chinese, with provision for 20 students annually. However, language within the contract raises potentially problematic leverage on the part of the Chinese state, including allowing \"corrective measures\" against the university, requiring the program to obey Chinese laws that have been used to silence critics, and multiple mechanisms to halt funding, from yearly evaluations to holding any mediation in a Chinese setting. A former head of propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party has called Confucius Institutes \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up,\" and multiple other contracts between Chinese state-run educational establishments and western universities have run into issues of academic freedom and censorship.",

Similarly, the mayor of Arnstadt, where Chinese firm Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. has decided to invest $2 billion in a new factory, has said that \"It’s not my job to talk about\" human rights violations and other problematic Chinese activity. Chinese investment in places like Duisburg, where almost 100 Chinese companies have established a presence, even extend influence to educational settings, with one local principal saying that new Chinese language instruction will \"portray a realistic image [of China]. By learning Chinese, students will be able to see things as they are.\" The focus on economic relations over political concerns likely carries additional weight in struggling locales like Duisburg, where the unemployment rate is more than triple the national average</p>",

The proposed deal valued at nearly $732 million reportedly drew U.S. and German concerns that the company's technology could be adapted for military purposes by the People's Liberation Army, given CCP laws requiring companies to cooperate with security interests. Additional concern came from suggestions of improper dealing in advance of the decision to sell. Specifically, San’an Optoelectronics, a different Chinese entity but one under the control of the same state-run semiconductor fund, canceled an order from Aixtron, which caused its value to plummet and gave FGC an opening to negotiate advantageously.",

With his new position, Schröder took on an even greater role with the controversial project, which many Central and Eastern European states strongly oppose due to the potentially destabilizing geopolitical consequences.

According to Deutsche Welle, there were \"rumors that the Berlin center is to be the headquarters of a worldwide network of such institutions, aimed at making 'Russia's view of the world popular.'\" Although the funding of the organization is not public, DOC denies receiving any Russian government funding. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that Yakunin was planning to invest 25 million euros over five years, and it was suspected that several other Russian businessmen had invested in DOC. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Vladimir Yakunin in 2014 for “involvement in the situation in Ukraine” due to his position as a high-ranking government official and as a member of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. The U.S. Treasury Department described Yakunin as a \"close confidant\" of Vladimir Putin.",

Commerzbank was fined €7.3 million by the Frankfurt civil court. In 2012, four of the defendants settled the charges, while the charges against the fifth were dropped due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.",

For instance, German outlets including Handelsblatt and Süddeutsche Zeitung publish China Watch, a paid media placement prepared by the China Daily, over which the CCP exercises financial and editorial control. Similarly, a newsletter from DPA, Germany's largest press agency, now carries content from Xinhua, including materials promoting the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing's effort to fuse infrastructure and economic investments with geopolitical influence. Hamburg-based Europe Times is owned by a company touting \"excellent connections to companies, officials, ministries and associations in China,\" with scarce detail publicly available on what these connections entail. Though proponents of the media collaboration efforts note that such content is usually listed as paid advertising, critics still contend that Chinese state media are piggybacking off of the greater trust citizens place in their local news outlets, and that standalone content from a foreign authoritarian government would not be very persuasive.",

Financial records show Held received nearly half a million euros from RT’s parent company, TV Novosti, through a firm he controls in Russia. Though previously blocked under the name “Russian Code,” Held’s rebranded channel continues to grow across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Other influencers reportedly backed by RT include “Sasha Meets Russia” and German Russian commentator Alina Lipp.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Marsalek conveyed allegations that the BVT was investigating the FPÖ via an anonymous dossier distributed by two BVT double agents. He then promoted the documents via the Austro-Russian Friendship society, actively targeting Russophile far-right politician Johann Gudenus to nurture his mistrust of the intelligence unit. As a result, on 28 February 2018, the premises of Austrian intelligence service were raided by local policemen looking for evidence of corruption and mishandling of sensitive data. The raid was ultimately signed off by the FPÖ-led ministry of interior. Evidence suggests that the Kremlin intended the operation to lay the groundwork for a rebuilding of the intelligence service under a new leadership more favorable to Moscow.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

In December, A1's cybersecurity team noticed the intrusion, but it wasn’t until May 22, 2020 that they were able to remove the malware and boot the hackers from the system. The delay came from the team's maneuvers to avoid alerting the hackers to A1’s awareness of their presence in the system, and from several unfortunate postponements caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The main suspect for this attack is the PLA hacking group called Gallium. The fact that the attackers did not use ransomware or encrypt any data points to a state-controlled group, Gallium targeted many telecom companies in 2018 and 2019 to steal their data, and the attack pattern fit their usual modus operandi. However, there was no official attribution of the attack on A1 Telekom.",

The plot, orchestrated by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, funneled over USD $15 million from Russian banks into the accounts of more than 130,000 Moldovans, amounting to 5% of all Moldovan residents, with the aim of influencing the vote against pro-European policies. Shor had previously led protests against President Maia Sandu’s pro-Western government. The Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies suggested that Shor was behind attacks on official buildings such as the Moldovan Ministry of Labor, the Government Building and the Central Election Commission. The Swedish non-profit also reported that Moldovan police had arrested several suspects who were trained outside Moscow and paid to carry out vandalism and violent protests. In addition, Moldova’s national security adviser, Stanislav Secrieru, accused the Kremlin of “flooding the political landscape with clone parties and candidates, from pro-Russian to phony pro-European.”</p>",

The Digital Forensic Research Lab found that the celebrities were paid to read a script in Russian, a language most of them likely did not understand. The individual clips were then edited into a video compilation that was first shared on TikTok. The account has since been deleted. The longer edit was later reposted in prominent Telegram channels and reproduced in Russian media and on various other platforms. While researchers could not establish a direct link to the Kremlin with complete certainty, the smear of Sandu followed the modus operandi of a similar Russian-sponsored operation from July 2023. There, Russian operatives had hired celebrities on Cameo to record videos calling for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to seek treatment for alleged substance abuse.</p>",

The attempt was thwarted thanks to information released on February 9, 2023, by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While Ukrainian authorities simply spoke of plans “by the Russian intelligence”, the Moldovan President attributed the operation to Wagner Group’s since-deceased leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. The coup was part of a larger strategy to destabilize the country politically. Russian forces intended to support the coup with various tactics including provoking societal unrest, encouraging anti-government protests to turn violent by hiring aggressive rioters, and bribing voters with money smuggled into the country through cash mules and bank cards issued in Dubai. According to Moldovan intelligence, Russia illegally channeled more than $55 million into the country for political purposes in 2023.</p>",

The sanctions froze assets and property interests of nine individuals and twelve entities. Sanctioned individuals included the Moldavian populist leader Ilan Shor, who, according to the Treasury Department, collaborated with Russia ahead of the 2021 Moldovan elections, aiming to control the parliament and support legislation favorable to Russia. Another sanctioned individual was Vladimir Plahotniuc, a former Moldovan member of parliament who directed law enforcement to investigate political opponents ahead of 2018 elections. A company called the National Engineering Corporation (NIK) was also sanctioned. Igor Yuryevich Chayka, a son of a member of Russia’s Security Council, invested millions of dollars to set up NIK, which seemingly operated as an engineering firm for Russian business technology projects.  </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Gazprom raised the cost of gas deliveries to Moldova from $550 to $790 per cubic meters, while cutting its gas supply by one-third, after the two parties’ contract expired in September 2021. Gazprom told Moldovan officials that gas prices would be lowered if the country amended its tariff-free trade deal with the EU and delayed the implementation of EU rules that would increase competition in the gas market. Moldova declared a state of emergency in October, and the European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell accused Russia of weaponizing its gas supply. On October 28, Gazprom and Moldova announced a five-year deal that will provide the country with gas at almost half of the current market price. Moldovan President Maia Sandu subsequently declared the end of her country’s energy crisis.  </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

In November 2014, these banks then lent about $1 billion – about 15% of Moldovan GDP – to Shor-linked companies in Britain and Hong Kong. When the government bailed out the banks, the Moldovan currency (lei) and economy were devastated. According to a confidential report from U.S. investigative firm Kroll, the loans were “‘enabled by deposits from external financial institutions, including [three Russian banks] Gazprombank, Interprombank, and Alef Bank.’” Shor was arrested in 2015 for money laundering and embezzlement, although he was released from house arrest in June to compete in Orhei’s mayoral elections, which he won. Massive protests erupted, and the EU, IMF, and World Bank all “[froze] their financial assistance to Moldova.” On October 19, 2015, Moldova’s central bank revoked the banks’ licenses and initiated their liquidation. When the government resigned under pressure from protesters, “Pro-Kremlin parties rushed to exploit the crisis.” Further investigation revealed that some of Shor’s shell companies were also involved in the $20.8 billion money laundering scheme known as the Russian Laundromat.",

KAPO found that Hantsom was part of a long chain of command, which eventually traced back to the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. He also belonged to a political party in Estonia that supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and was a contributor on Kremlin-sponsored propaganda outlet Sputnik Estonia. Estonian security services found a list of targets that included prominent politicians and journalists who had exposed Kremlin propaganda on the war in Ukraine with Estonia’s Russian-speaking population.

The strategic paper was drafted by the Russian Presidential Administration’s Directorate for Cross-Border Cooperation, a body staffed by Russian intelligence officers from the FSB (State Security), SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service) and GRU (Military Intelligence Service), and presented Moscow’s long-term strategy to exert influence over the politics of the three Baltic states.

In response to these plans, Huawei employed a PR firm counting multiple former Estonian ministers among its members, raising additional concerns about indirect influence. Media reports suggest that the former ministers brokered numerous meetings between Huawei and current lawmakers or officials in an effort to reverse the planned regulation, though, in the absence of any lobbying regulation in Estonia, what was discussed in those meetings and who attended them was not logged in any official record. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.",

Contracts would have been awarded to state-linked firms including China Railway International Group, China Railway Engineering Company, and the China Communications Construction Company, but a July 31, 2020 statement from Estonian Minister of Public Administration Jaak Aab mentioned \"environmental, economic, and security reasons\" to doubt the project's viability. Among the government's expressed concerns included additional costs for \"developing and maintaining national defense capabilities,\" likely relating to securing transit access in any crisis. More broadly, however, the government appears wary of having an important piece of the country's infrastructure dependent on Chinese financing. A Chinese-owned company, Touchstone Capital Partners, had nominally pledged up to 15 billion euros for the tunnel project in partnership with Finnish private company FinEst Bay Area Development, but a UK report in 2019 found that Touchstone only had assets of £1. The planned tunnel, some 100km in length, potentially would have formed a portion of China's Belt and Road Initiative, especially if it could eventually link to other projects in the Arctic or the Balkans. An Estonian think tank report raised concerns of the project inviting more Chinese political and strategic presence in the country, potentially blurring economic and military aims with dual-use investments.",

A statement from the Chinese embassy requested that Estonia \"stop interfering in China's internal affairs,\" and that Estonia's actions \"seriously violate the basic principles of international relations,\" among other critiques. After the meeting occurred, China halted a planned visit from Estonian Agriculture Minister Helir-Valdor Seeder, and effectively cut off access to Chinese markets for Estonian dairy exporters, an industry exporting more than 200 million euros of products annually. Minister for Foreign Trade and Entrepreneurship Anne Sulling acknowledged the connection, admitting that \"we have not been successful in the Chinese market since the Estonian officials welcomed the Dalai Lama here.\" Estonian milk producers did not receive full access until 2016, though higher-level diplomatic relations normalized in 2014.",

He had started communications with Ukrainian intelligence regarding his anticipated defection around a year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. On August 9, 2023, Kuzminov flew his Mi-8 transport helicopter towards the Ukrainian border, where he defected. Ukrainian authorities paid him USD $500,000 for defecting. Although Spain’s Civil Guard never officially confirmed that the body found in Villajoyosa was Kuzimov’s, they identified a Russian former KGB officer a Russian police colonel present in the country at the time of the killing as “persons of interest” in the case. Spanish media reported at the time of the killing that Spanish intelligence thought that the Kremlin was behind the assassination.</p>",

According to a European intelligence report reviewed by the New York Times, the aim of these meetings was to secure the Kremlin’s support for the independence movement in Catalonia. Both Alay and Puigdemont confirmed that the trips occurred. In March 2019, accompanied by Alexander Dmitrenko, who was refused Spanish citizenship due to his ties to Russian intelligence, Alya met Sergei Sumin, a colonel of Putin's personal security detail. Alay also met Edvard Chesnokov, deputy editor of the international section of Komsomolskaya Pravda, Russia's second largest daily newspaper who Spanish outlet El Confidencial describes as “a key player in the Kremlin's propaganda during the invasion of Ukraine”. In June 2019, Alay and Dmitrenko met with Andrei Bezrukov, a former officer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Alay also met with Evgeni Primakov, a former member of the State Duma for Putin’s party and the grandson of a former head of the SVR. In June 2020, Primakov was appointed by Putin as head of Rossotrudnichestvo, a government agency under Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov tied to Russia's global influence campaigns. In the months that followed, Puigdemont was interviewed by state media outlets Russia 24, Russia Today, and Sputnik. According to El Confidencial, Alay also met with Arkady Seregin, an advisor to the Russian Ministry of Energy linked to the SVR.</p>",

The Spanish military has no formal presence in Ukraine and the soldiers were likely from the International Legion, a unit of volunteers from around the world who fight under the supervision of Ukrainian intelligence. Published just days after the new ambassador had presented his credentials to the Spanish King, the video was promptly removed before Klimenko’s meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>",

The Russians reportedly offered $500 billion and 10,000 armed soldiers to facilitate Catalonia’s bid for independence in exchange for favorable cryptocurrency legislation. According to Christopher Nehring, a lecturer in intelligence history at the University of Potsdam, the proposal combined “a covert, intelligence-backed support for a separatist movement with a scam or fraud component on the side”. A member of this group, Nikolai Sadovnikov, was flagged by a Western intelligence agency as having a direct line to Vladimir Putin. A 2012 report from that agency assessed as a “credible hypothesis” that Sadovnikov worked for Russian intelligence agent. In 2020, a Spanish judge investigating the diversion of public funds for the independence movement confirmed that a Russian offer was indeed made to Puigdemont, but that the Catalonian leader had rejected it.</p>",

An analysis of more than 5 million messages about Catalonia posted on social networks during this time period showed that 32 percent of the messages investigated came from Venezuela, and 30 percent were born from anonymous accounts \"exclusively dedicated\" to promoting content from Russian state-sponsored media outlets RT and Sputnik, according to the Daily Beast. Additionally, messages from RT and Sputnik's official social media presence accounted for ten percent of the messages. Articles from RT and Sputnik reportedly sought to inflame tensions and spread exaggerated claims of violence ahead of the referendum.",

He died on November 23, 2006 as a result of this poisoning. Right before his death, Litvinenko claimed that it was Putin himself who had ordered his assassination. The European Court of Human Rights determined that two Russian intelligence officers, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, were responsible for the assassination. British authorities agreed that the Kremlin orchestrated the poisoning and that former head of the FSB, Nikolai Patrushev, had approved the assassination alongside President Putin. The Polonium was traced back to a nuclear reactor in the Urals and went through production in the Russian town of Sarov. From there, an FSB laboratory was able to create a drinkable substance containing the radioactive compound.</p>",

The nerve agent, identified as Novichok, caused significant bodily harm to both Skripal and his daughter, as well as to Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. The police believed that two Russian nationals going by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were responsible for the Novichok attacks. The men claimed that they were in Salisbury as tourists, but the Bellingcat investigation team produced several in-depth reports tying them conclusively to the GRU, Russian military intelligence. In response to the incident, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the United Kingdom, triggering similar actions from other European allies. In August 2018, the United States imposed its own sanctions on Russia as a result of the Novichok attack.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The hackers accessed McDonald’s messages when he opened an email disguised as a military update about Ukraine from a member of his staff. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was already on alert about the Russian hacking group, which is known as “Seaborgium.” NCSC alleged the group is responsible for a highly targeted campaign against individual politicians, activists, and journalists.

On October 21, 2022, French newspaper Le Figaro reported that French instructors had also been retained, in exchange for three-year lucrative contracts of 20,000 euros per month. Sky News alleged that British instructors were more numerous than the French and estimated around 30 Royal Air Force former pilots were involved in trainings provided at the “Test Flying Academy of South Africa”, a company with no connection to the South African government. The objective of the hires was to develop Chinese military air force capabilities, notably their ability to land on aircraft carriers, and to teach pilots how to best counter NATO capabilities. The UK government has since sought to pass legislation to prevent former UK military personnel from getting involved in such contracts with rivals and US authorities are seeking the extradition of a former Marine corps pilot over trainings he provided to Chinese military pilots at the “Academy”.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Videos posted on social media showed the consul and several men come out of the consulate to pull down banners before dragging a protester on the consulate’s grounds and beating them up. As a result of the outrage that followed the revelations, British authorities summoned China’s charge d’affaires to London, Yang Xiaoguang, for an explanation. The same week, the Manchester consul gave a TV interview in which he justified his actions by saying that it was his “duty” to attack the protester after the man had “abused my country, my leader”. In December 2022, as the Manchester police asked to question six officials, including the consul, over the incident, Chinese authorities moved them out of the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The information operation has links to Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who founded the infamous Internet Research Agency troll farm and has been sanctioned by multiple Western countries. The new troll farm pushes disinformation across eight social media platforms, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok. Directors of the troll farm called on supporters to target specific Kremlin critics, politicians, and media. They also asked individuals aligned with the information operation to turn on VPNs and flood comment sections rather than post original content in order to make it more difficult for social media platforms to identify their campaign. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Two days before the match, Özil criticized the Chinese government and the silence of the global Muslim community in the face of ongoing human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Chinese state media described Özil’s action as “false” and expressed the “disappointment” of Chinese fans and football authorities. A Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson further denounced Ozil, saying he was “deceived by false news reports.” Arsenal rapidly distanced itself from the player, insisting that the tweet constituted Özil’s personal views. For the English Premier League, China had become a major overseas market, with the signature of a three-year TV rights deal worth $700 million in 2019.</p>",

According to BuzzFeed News, hackers breached the Integrity Initiative's servers some time in 2018.  Tranches of the stolen documents appeared on hacktivist website CyberGuerilla in four separate releases from November 2018 through January 2019.   Russian state-sponsored media amplified the hacked materials, including screenshots and quotes of sensitive internal documents, in an attempt to discredit the think tank and undermine its work in exposing Russian interference efforts. In response, the Integrity Initiative temporarily moved its public materials offline, replacing its website with a description of the hack that indicated that some disseminated documents had been doctored.",

On November 11, 2018, The Guardian reported that Banks’ insurance company and Leave.EU were fined £60,000 for “serious breaches of the law that governs electronic marketing.”",

Nimmo claimed that the trolls utilized Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook accounts to claim that the election was manipulated. Nimmo stated that \"'the allegations of fraud demonstrably had an impact; pro-Kremlin accounts demonstrably boosted those allegations. The anger and disappointment felt by many yes voters were entirely sincere [and] those sentiments were fanned by pro-Kremlin trolls, in a manner characteristic of Russian influence operations.'\"</p>",

Security analysts believe the hackers intended to access control systems using a massive spear phishing operation. Emails disguised as job applications and complaints were sent to engineers who had access to the control systems. While no disruption was caused, according to British media, \"a number of Industrial Control System engineering and services organisations are likely to have been compromised.\"",

State-owned China General Nuclear Power (CGN) holds a 33% stake in the £20bn Hinkley reactor, a project which is a part of a broader UK program aimed at curbing the country's net carbon emissions. According to the Guardian, May decided to delay the signing of a subsidy deal due to the Chinese government's proprietorship of sensitive infrastructure within Britain. Nick Timothy, May's joint chief of staff and aide said that officials were worried that the Chinese government might \"use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems, which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will.\" Nevertheless, days after announcing the review, Downing Street approved continuation of the project with \"a new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain's critical infrastructure.\" According to the Washington Post, \"Hinkley Point may have been too far along in the planning by the time she took office for her to cancel the project.\"",

The station is marketed to the UK's Muslim population and also reportedly reaches a significant audience in Russia and Central Asia. The UK Government's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) exposed the operation in an October 2018 report providing evidence of four Russian government Cyber Operations against targets in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ukraine. The NCSC assessed with \"high confidence\" that GRU officers were behind the attacks, and that the actors likely belonged to the same group as the suspects in the March 2018 Salisbury chemical attack.  According to the NCSC, the hackers deployed phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks, among other tactics. The hackers' motivation for targeting Islam Channel remains unclear, although experts theorize the attack may have been a training exercise or part of a larger campaign to infiltrate European media organizations in 2015.",

The Sunday Times reported that this report on Russian threats posed to U.K. democracy identifies nine oligarchs and other wealthy Tory donors.   Noting that some Russian donors are personally close to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Times points to former Russian defense ministry official and arms tycoon Alexander Temerko who has given £1.2 million to the Conservatives since becoming a British citizen in 2011. The Times also identifies \"the largest Russian Tory donor\" to be Lubov Chernukhin, the wife a former ally of Putin who became a U.K. citizen in or around 2009. The Conservative Party treasurer, Ehud Sheleg, began donating millions to the Tories after his art gallery business struck a deal with a Cypriot company owned by two powerful Russian businessmen in 2015.   In 2016, a Labour MP raised concerns that a £400,000 donation to the Tories came from Gérard Lopez, the chairman of a private investment fund that had recently signed infrastructure deals worth billions with Russia and whose managing partner is understood to be close to Putin.   While these individuals' ties to Russia have been discussed in British media, there is no suggestion that they are among the nine businesspeople reportedly named in the parliamentary report, which Prime Minister Johnson prevented from becoming public before the 2019 general election.",

Scythian and Shetler-Jones have made donations to the Conservatives central office, Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones (payments that were reportedly presented by MI5 as evidence of why she shouldn't be appointed National Security Advisor), and MP Robert Halfon. Richard Spring, a Conservative MP who is known as Lord Risby and chairs the Firtash-funded British Ukrainian Society, has accepted advisory fees from a Cyprus company called Spadi Trading Ltd., which is owned by a British Virgin Islands entity called Interbean Ltd., which in turn is controlled by Shetler-Jones. Firtash also uses a network of charitable foundations working alongside his shell companies to buy influence in London. He established and funds the British Ukrainian Society, which employs former U.K. spies and lawmakers and pays for current members of parliament to visit Ukraine and meet associates of Firtash. His company's charitable fund bankrolled an influential London festival focused on Ukraine. And his DF Foundation donated £4.3 million to Cambridge University's Ukraine studies program.",

Since the assassination, the Russian government and its state-sponsored media outlets have carried out coordinated efforts to deflect blame for Litvinenko’s murder, including suggesting Litvinenko was secretly dealing polonium, claiming Litvinenko poisoned himself, accusing the U.K. government of assassinating Litvinenko, and other widespread efforts to cast doubt on the U.K. investigation.

An official from the Russian embassy in Slovakia attended the opening event. According to Slovak security analyst Jaroslav Nad, the headquarters is \"almost a military base\" for the group, which he describes as a paramilitary group funded by the Russian government. The Slovak foreign ministry called the news \"disturbing,\" and said that the group would need to be \"carefully monitored.\" In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Night Wolves due to their support for Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Treasury Department described the group as \"closely connected to the Russian special services.\"",

Although a technical issue was used as justification for the cuts, Gazprom has regularly used similar reasons when disrupting energy flows for political purposes.",

According to EUObserver, former head of Estonian intelligence Eerik-Niiles Kross alleged in 2017 that the Slovak Conscripts recieved training from Russian military intelligence officers (GRU). The Slovak Conscripts also reportedly maintain connections to the Russian government-connected Night Wolves biker gang. In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Night Wolves due to their support for Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The event commemorates a Tibetan popular uprising in 1959 in which tens of thousands of Tibetans were killed. Swiss municipalities have commemorated the event yearly by raising the Tibetan flag. However, in 2020, the Vaud authorities sent a letter to ten municipalities requesting that they not participate in the demonstration because it violates Switzerland’s One China Policy. In fact, the Chinese ambassador had written to the Vaud government and asked them to stop the demonstration. The GSTF president, Thomas Büchli, stated that such an action from Chinese officials was not unusual, but the response of the Swiss government was. Ralph Weber, an expert in Chinese intervention, stated that this move was common in United Front work. China uses \"United Front\" work to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP’s United Front Work Department (UFWD)—the agency responsible for coordinating these kinds of influence operations—mostly focuses on the management of potential opposition groups inside China, but it also has an important foreign influence mission.",

These officials could enter Switzerland for two weeks at a time, unofficially, and work to determine if the illegal immigrants were of Chinese nationality, even having the right to interrogate them. If it was determined that the illegal immigrants were Chinese, the officials would work in concert with the SEM to deport them back to China. The agreement was never officially published, and some members of Parliament had never heard of it. It garnered attention in Autumn 2020, because it was set to expire in December of the same year. The excuse given for the secrecy surrounding the agreement was that it is an administrative agreement and thus not legally required to be published. In September 2020, the SEM began talks with CCP officials over renewing the agreement. However, while the SEM has expressed a desire to renew the agreement, other Swiss officials are staunchly against it. While Tibetans and Uyghurs are excluded from the illegal immigrants subject to this agreement, other rejected asylum seekers are not, and there is no information available about what happens to the irregular migrants after they return to China.",

The project intends to increase traffic, efficiency, and trade volume, while also presenting an alternative trading route to Russia. China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) and China Harbor Investment, alongside subcontractors China Road and Bridge Corporation and Qingdao Port International, were the only contenders to submit a final proposal for the construction and operation of the port, granting the PRC a 49% share. The choice of partners lacked transparency and some of the companies in the consortium are internationally sanctioned. CCCC was banned from World bank-financed construction projects from 2011 to 2017 for participating in fraud and bribery, and sanctioned by the US for promoting militarization in the South China Sea in 2020. And the Bangladeshi government blacklisted China Harbor Engineering Company for corruption in 2018.</p>",

The Georgian Foreign Ministry said that the agreement was a violation of Georgian and international laws. Georgian law forbids foreign companies “access to develop oil fields in the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia without the authorization of the Georgian government,” while the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea “obliges foreign companies to obtain the permission of sovereign state authorities to engage in economic activity in its marine areas.” The action was denounced as a move by Russia to assert its influence over the occupied regions and gain an economic advantage over Georgia.",

Critics have raised concerns about incidents of infringement upon intellectual freedom at Confucius Institutes, whose terms of agreement and financial details are often hidden. A former head of propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party has called them \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.\" Latvia's security service, as well as Lithuania's and other European services, have warned that the institutes can be \"disseminating ideological messages favorable to China’s Communist party\" to potentially unsuspecting academic or social audiences. Latvian students at the institute have reported being denied the chance to discuss Hong Kong and other sensitive topics, as well as being unnecessarily photographed by Chinese faculty \"for their reports.\"",

An analyst also says that the prolonged, persistent duration of the attacks, the sophisticated, evolving nature of the phishing emails used, and the choice of government ministries as targets - rather than commercial entities - combine to suggest a state-affiliated cyber campaign rather than criminals seeking to make a profit. Technical similarities also exist between the series of attacks on foreign ministries and later attacks on finance ministries in advance of a G-20 summit.",

Transneft attributed the decision to high tariff prices, but officials and experts believe Moscow intended to pressure Latvia to sell a stake in Ventspils port’s operator Ventspils Nafta to Russian state-owned entities. After Latvian state and private owners refused to transfer port management to Russian ownership, Transneft suspended oil deliveries, and then rerouted all oil shipments through the Russian port of Primorsk. As described by Nicholas Redman of the Economist Intelligence Unit in London, \"In the year that Latvia received the NATO invitation, [we] see fairly naked economic-political pressure from Russia ... The motive is to gain control of Ventspils Nafta and with it, the pipeline running between Russia and Latvia.\"",

The transfer wasn’t fully effective until March 2022, raising the possibility that PwC breached fresh EU sanctions against Mordashov. PwC had been working with Mordashov since the early 2000s and, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, helped him administer a holding company tied to more than 65 shell companies in fiscal havens. PwC also helped move assets belonging to metals magnates Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov ahead of UK sanctions. According to ICIJ, the auditing firm was engaged with at least 12 of the 25 Russian oligarchs sanctioned at the time of the 2014 annexation of Crimea. But it only terminated its business activities in Russia and “ordered its affiliates to stop working for sanctioned clients” two months after the invasion of Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

One of the new board members was Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB official alleged to be close to Vladimir Putin, who also served as the former CEO of Norilsk Nickel (and received a $100 million severance). As of June 2018, the largest shareholder in the bank is Viktor Vekselberg, whom the U.S. Treasury Department designated under the Russia sanctions program in April 2018.",

In the Italian regional councils of Veneto, Lombardy and Liguaria, politicians like the far-right Stefano Valdegamberi were paid to promote IACP-drafted motions calling for an end to European sanctions against Russia. Additionally, IACP leveraged its connections to publish articles in local tabloids that legitimized the annexation of Crimea. IACP also organized a luxury trip for Italian politicians and businesspeople to Crimea, paid for by the Kremlin-linked construction company <em>Granel</em>, that facilitated talks to bring Russian money to Italy in industries like construction, steel, and wine – violating European sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

In September 2021, the Guardia di Finanza, the Italian financial crimes police, had placed six managers of the drones manufacturer under investigation over the planned sale of their company to two Chinese state-owned enterprises. The BBC reports that Alpi Aviation produces military grade drones for NATO. The six managers oversaw the sale of 75% of the shares in Alpi Aviation to a Hong Kong-based firm that acted as a front for a complex web of corporations that ultimately led to the Management Committee of Wuxi Liyuan Economic Development Zone and to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC), the body responsible for managing Chinese state-owned enterprises. The sale was in breach of Italian investment screening and arms control legislation. Following the sale, Alpi Aviation had plans to move its drone production to a technology hub in Wuxi, 135km west of Shanghai.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Recorded Future, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, attributed the attacks to RedDelta, a state-affiliated Chinese hacking group. The Holy See’s Study Mission to China, which is run by representatives of the Vatican, is based in Hong Kong-based. Beijing and the Vatican cut diplomatic ties in 1951. For the next 67 years, Chinese Catholics were divided into those who followed a state-recognized church and those who followed an underground Vatican-recognized church. In 2018, the Vatican and Beijing came to a temporary agreement, set to expire in September 2020. The details of the agreement are murky, but its goal was to unify the two Catholic churches by negotiating for control over the election of bishops in China. Reportedly, Beijing would select bishops and the Vatican would approve them. Critics urged the Vatican not to accept this deal, which gave Beijing control over Catholic citizens. It is unclear whether the hackers were attempting to obtain information to use in the negotiation or were monitoring the groups to determine their involvement in the pro-democracy unrest in Hong Kong. The attacks have intensified since the official extension of the agreement in October, with fake emails impersonating journalists from the Union of Catholic Asia News and a new kind of malware deployed by the Chinese state-linked hackers.",

The claim was accompanied by a video, which showed Italians cheering with the Chinese national anthem in the background. However, Italian fact-checking and manipulation experts examined the video and determined that while the first fifteen seconds may be unaltered, it is likely that the majority of the video was doctored by taking footage of Italians cheering for medical staff and playing the Chinese national anthem under it.",

Formiche also reported that 37.1% of the tweets with the hashtag #grazieCina (\"Thank you China\") published over the same period were posted by bots. At the same time, Chinese diplomats and state media were actively highlighting the Italian people's purported thankfulness towards China. Beside the narrative convergence, many of the accounts amplifying these pro-Chinese narratives on Twitter bore the same hallmarks of inauthenticity observed by experts in others cases of Chinese information manipulation campaigns. Particularly egregious was the fact that the same bots also included EU-related hashtags in their tweets, shaming the organization for its inaction on coronavirus. At the end of March 2020, the parliamentary committee in charge of Italian intelligence publicly announced that an infodemic that could be traced back to \"external state actors\" was targeting Italy.",

Taranto is an essential port for both NATO and the EU. The city hosts a NATO military naval base and supports the organization’s Standing Naval Force in the Mediterranean Sea, which conducts counterterrorism, fights against migrant trafficking, and participates in joint exercises. The EU’s counter migrant trafficking operation, also relies on Taranto. Adolfo Urso, vice-President of the Italian oversight body for state intelligence agencies, and Italian MEP Anna Bonfrisco have expressed concern over the possible sale and Bonfrisco has asked the EU to investigate. The Ferretti Group hoped to establish a production center and a research center in Taranto, but the deal was slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, Senator Mario Turco, undersecretary to the presidency of the Council of Ministers, expressed support for the deal, emphasizing the economic benefits for the region.",

In a secret recording of the meeting, the aide, Gianluca Savoini, discusses a scheme whereby a Russian oil company would sell fuel at a discount to the Italian Eni company through intermediaries. These middlemen would then transfer the discount - valued at around $65 million - to Lega. While it is uncertain whether the transaction took place, it would have been illegal under Italian law. The discussion, conducted in Moscow by Savoini, two other Italians, and three Russians with apparent government ties, was first revealed in February 2019 by L'Espresso.",

The campaign was initiated after the President refused to appoint anti-EU Paolo Savona as Minister of Economy, according to Corriere.it. Researchers at Clemson University initially discovered the Russian accounts' connection to the resign movement, and Twitter later confirmed the accounts connection to the Russian government-connected Internet Research Agency (IRA). According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the IRA is “a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Evgeniy Prigozhin, \"a Russian oligarch who is closely identified with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” provides funding and support for the IRA.",

He was bribed by Chinese intermediaries with gifts, money, and favors to share confidential information on high-level Italian companies and assist Chinese investors in determining which Italian companies were strategic investments. Using his position, he created a network of insider knowledge. The confidential information shared included the trade secrets of Italian state-owned and strategic companies like Enel, an energy company, and information on strategic infrastructure in Italy, Spain, and France. He notably gave information on the telecommunications sector to Chinese intermediaries investing on behalf of Huawei. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.",

ICFA is the Italian variation of a global network of PRC friendship groups, non-diplomatic organizations which seek to promote bilateral relations between foreign nations and the Chinese state. According to U.S. policy research institute the Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments, \"friendship groups are often disguised as homegrown organizations run by the host country's own citizens.\" However, the research institute also explains that the groups then act as fronts to promote Beijing's domestic and foreign policy agendas. CPAFFC's involvement in the founding of ICFA suggests that the latter organization's work might extend beyond the local-level concerns typical of partnership agreements.",

Nevertheless, Clini called one of these poorly executed projects, \"intelligent, ecological, and energy efficient,\" and pointed to a report commissioned by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, which received more than 70 million euros from the grants Clini oversaw, which judged the projects to be in \"excellent\" condition.

According to BBC News, the Russian officials attempted to \"obtain and distribute sensitive information\" and to bribe Greek officials. The diplomats apparently encouraged rallies opposing the June 17 Greek-Macedonian deal regarding the latter's name. The Financial Times reported that the Russian officials used local businessmen as intermediaries \"to bribe local government officials, Orthodox clergymen, and members of cultural associations and far-right groups\" in northern Greece to oppose the deal. At least one Greek soldier was also approached. Ekathimerini reported that, according to high-level Greek diplomatic sources, the political efforts followed sustained Russian attempts to gain influence in the Greek Orthodox Church.",

The 320 million euro sale comes as part of Greece's international bailout agreement between the country, the International Monetary Fund, and eurozone nations. In May 2017, the European Commission issued an assessment asking the Greek regulatory authority to more closely analyze the risks tied to the partial ownership of ADMIE by a company ultimately owned by the Chinese state. In particular, the Commission seemed concerned about actions by Beijing that would harm security of supply in the EU. A Reuters article from May 2017 also reports that, through its stake in ADMIE, State Grid has been looking for ways to get involved in \"the 1.5 billion-euro EuroAsia Interconnector project which aims to link up via subsea cables the power transmission systems of Israel, Cyprus and Greece.\"",

The Greek government received $647 million upfront in 2010, with the rest meant to be received out of future earnings. In his book \"Adults in the Room,\" former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis reports that the Chinese ambassador to Greece told him in 2015 that: \"from Beijing’s perspective, Cosco is the dragon’s jaw. First, we must ensure that its teeth bite hard so that the dragon gets in. Once it is in, have no concerns or doubt: the rest of the dragon will follow.’ COSCO became the majority owner of Piraeus in 2016 and the Chinese state committed to spending an additional $660 million to continue the port's development in 2019.",

These cyberattacks disrupted online programming at Sweden’s national public broadcaster and the websites of Scandinavian Airlines, the state-owned power company Vattenfall, and the defense firm Saab AB. Truesec, one of Sweden’s biggest cybersecurity firms, provided evidence that the group is not Islamist but a well-organized unit of Russian hackers. Truesec was unable to determine whether the group consisted of Russian government employees or pro-Russia hackers. Katarzyna Zysk, a professor of international relations at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, said that the hackers’ timing, targets, and in-depth knowledge of Swedish politics points to Russian intelligence service involvement. Anonymous Sudan continues to claim to be a Sudanese hacktivist group and assert that its attacks on Sweden were prompted by the burning of a Koran in Stockholm. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The Swedish foreign minister described the threat as “completely unacceptable” but stopped short of expelling the Chinese ambassador. The Swedish Foreign Ministry had already summoned the Chinese ambassador in January 2021 over perceived threatening statement addressed at Swedish media.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The online outrage was notably fanned by groups like the Communist Youth League, the CCP's youth arm. On March 26, a spokesperson for Xinjiang's local government declared that \"Can H&amp;M continue to make money in the Chinese market? Not anymore.\" Chinese diplomats and state media closely covered the boycott, repeatedly showing empty H&amp;M shops and interviewing indignant Chinese consumers. H&amp;M's listings were wiped off popular Chinese shopping apps and the geo-locations of the Swedish brand's stores were also deleted, making it impossible for users to search them. Since the incident, some brands, like Zara's parent company, have pre-emptively taken down statements about Xinjiang from their websites.</p>",

The Chinese ambassador to Stockholm had already told the Swedish press in October 2020 that banning Huawei was an \"incorrect decision\" and that \"it could have negative consequences for Swedish companies working in China.\" In early January 2021, media reported that Ericssson's CEO was pressuring Swedish authorities to reverse the ban out of concerns that Ericsson might be excluded from the Chinese market in retaliation for the Huawei ban. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.</p>",

The video, which SWEDHR claimed depicted actors staging the aftermath of a fake chemical weapons attack, was actually footage of ‘White Helmet’ volunteers responding to a 2015 chemical attack. SWEDHR failed to reference the fact that the video was two years old at the time of its release. The Guardian reports that Russian state-sponsored media outlets RT and Sputnik seized on and deliberately circulated this disinformation in order to cast doubt on the work done by the White Helmets and the reality of the 2017 chemical attacks. Syria's UN ambassador also cited SWEDHR's claims at an April 12, 2017 Security Council meeting. Additionally, research commissioned by the human rights group the Syria Campaign, revealed that the network of Twitter users who discussed the White Helmets \"included many known pro-Kremlin troll accounts, some of which were closed down as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the US election.\"",

The sanctions targeted employees of the Strategic Culture Foundation, InfoRos, NewsFront, and SouthFront—all of which are Russian intelligence-linked sites that were sanctioned in April 2021. Treasury also designated new sites for being affiliated with the Strategic Culture Foundation, including Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton. The outlets New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review were sanctioned for being linked to Russia’s foreign intelligence agency. Sanctions also targeted the sites United World International and Geopolitica, which are connected to the Russian nationalists Darya Dugina and Alexander Dugin.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

In April, Ukraine’s State Special Communications Service said eight stations were being used by Russian forces to target local populations in southern Ukraine with disinformation and propaganda. The Kremlin’s strategy involves capturing transmitter towers and switching off access to Ukrainian national programs as well as violently forcing Ukrainian journalists to spread pro-Russian views. If violence doesn’t work, Russian forces have taken over and impersonated media outlets. Without a satellite, citizens in occupied areas only have access to Russian state TV channels. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Kremlin-linked social media accounts argued that Western sanctions and macroeconomic blunders sparked the food crisis, not Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian diplomats said that the West “artificially created” the food shortage as a “media stunt.” In June, the Foreign Ministry tweeted a link to an 11-page document, which purported to debunk eight myths pushed by the West about Russia’s role in triggering the food crisis. Moscow-affiliated messengers also blamed Ukraine for blocking food shipments by mining ports and claimed that Ukrainian soldiers had “torched 50,000 tons of grain.” Russia’s Ministry of Defense accused Kyiv of “food terrorism.” On July 22, Russia and Ukraine reached a deal to ensure the safe export of Ukrainian agricultural products, forcing Russia’s propaganda campaign around the issue to shift its focus.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Russian diplomatic accounts claimed a Tochka-U missile was used in the attack and that only Ukrainian forces use that type of weapon. Investigators later found evidence of Russian forces using those missiles. Russian diplomats also argued that “any [social media] user with a basic understanding of physics” could see that the missile came from Ukrainian territory, and they asserted that the serial number on the missile proved it belonged to the Ukrainian army. The Russian Embassy in Canada said the “Kiev junta” had ordered “neo-Nazis” to carry out the “heinous crime.” That same post argued that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “controlled by the Western intelligence services to destroy the people of Ukraine.” Other diplomatic accounts argued that Ukraine wanted to “maximize the number of civilian victims” to prevent and deter people from fleeing the country because Ukrainian forces intend to use civilians as “human shields.”</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Kremlin-linked accounts tweeted about “Bucha” in more than 1,200 posts between April 3 and April 10, 2022. State media claimed that the Bucha massacre was a “fake attack” staged by actors. Diplomats suggested that the United States and NATO “ordered” the false flag operation to sabotage peace talks and to justify additional sanctions against Russia. Russia’s foreign intelligence service said the head of the U.K.’s MI6 spy agency, Richard Moore, might have planned the Bucha incident. Moscow-affiliated accounts also insisted that the Western media was an “accomplice” to the fake attack. At the same time, Russian propagandists claimed that the dead bodies were real but that the people had been killed by Ukrainian forces for supporting Russia. One diplomatic account put out a 16-tweet-long thread, which asserted that the chronology of events proved Russia’s innocence and that a Ukrainian neo-Nazi had ordered the killings in Bucha. Officials and state-backed outlets predicted that “Ukraine and its Western propaganda-tutors” were planning to stage another attack to blame Russia. The U.S. State Department and independent investigators have disproven Russia’s narratives around Bucha. </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The hacking group, known as Sandworm, successfully infiltrated and disrupted the industrial control system of one power station, but defenders were able to prevent electrical outages, Ukrainian officials said. Leaked Ukrainian government documents, though, say that Russian hackers had temporarily shut down nine electric substations. Sandworm initially compromised the Ukrainian power station in February, around the time of Russia’s invasion, according to reports. The group used a malware variant called Industroyer2 that sought to damage high-voltage power substations. A destructive wiper malware known as CaddyWiper was also planted on systems to erase evidence of the attack. Sandworm was behind two pervious hacks that disrupted power supplies in Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The cyberattack hit ViaSat’s KA-SAT system, which provides high-speed satellite communications to Ukraine, disconnecting thousands of Ukrainians from the internet. The hack disrupted Ukraine’s ability to communicate with troops during the invasion, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated. The effects of the cyberattack spilled over into the broader region, interrupting satellite communications in the EU and affecting 5,800 wind turbines in Germany. U.S. officials suspect that Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, carried out the cyberattack by hacking and sabotaging ground-based modems, which disrupted communication with the satellites.    </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Kozak owns several news channels, which he used to amplify disinformation about the Zelensky administration. Kremlin-linked agents also worked with two former Ukrainian officials, Volodymyr Oliynyk and Vladimir Sivkovich, to build support for Ukraine to formally cede Crimea to Russia and to collect information on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

A communiqué by the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office alleged that Russia was considering former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential candidate. The statement noted that four other former high-ranking Ukrainian officials had been linked to Russia’s intelligence services. Some of those former officials had been in contact with Russian officers planning an attack on Ukraine, according to the announcement. The United Kingdom provided little information on the intelligence that led to the accusation. U.S. officials, though, supported the charges. Russia denied being involved in the plot. The U.K. warning came as Russia was massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine’s border.    </p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Russia’s military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, was involved in planning the video.

The joint statement, led by Canada and signed by more than 40 countries, asked that the Chinese government allow international independent observers in Xinjiang. According to two anonymous Western diplomats, Chinese officials pressured their Ukrainian counterparts by warning they would block a scheduled shipment of over 500,000 Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine doses. As of July 2021, Ukraine was no longer included in the list of countries supporting the joint statement. While Chinese officials denied that they had pressured Ukraine, British media subsequently reported that Beijing and Kiev agreed an investment deal just weeks after the latter removed its name from the joint statement. The Chinese authorities have committed serious human rights violations against the Uyghur ethnic group in Xinjiang, with several countries accusing the Chinese state of genocide.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Ukraine’s main security services, the SBU, has accused Gamaredon-linked hackers of working on behalf of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. According to the cybersecurity firm Anomali, which exposed the operation targeting Ukrainian officials, the hacking group sent emails posing as trusted contacts and distributed malware through deceptive .docx attachments. The documents centered on current political and security affairs and were likely private and legitimate files illicitly obtained and weaponized by the hacking group.

RT and Sputnik both falsely asserted that the Ukrainian vessels were in Russian territorial waters, and articles from Sputnik's French and German language services falsely indicated that Ukraine had planned to destroy the Kerch Strait Bridge between the Russian mainland and Crimea, currently under construction by Russia in violation of international law.  Sputnik English also carried a story that claimed Ukraine's western allies had prior knowledge of Ukrainian plans to \"provoke\" Russia by sending Ukrainian navy vessels through the international waters. Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated on Russia's Channel One, \"This is a deliberate provocation, of  which, I have no doubt, some of  our Western partners at  least knew, or maybe even took part in  the planning. All this is not accidental.\" Russian state-sponsored media outlets frequently attempt to blame the Ukrainian government for what the Russian government calls \"provocative\" acts.</p>",

According to technology magazine the Verge, the attack even affected the safety control systems of the Chernobyl power station, forcing the facility to shift to manual operations. The attackers simultaneously stole confidential information from several unnamed Ukrainian businesses. The NCSC believes with \"high confidence\" that GRU officers were behind the attacks, and that the actors likely belonged to the same group as the suspects in the March 2018 Salisbury chemical attack. The NCSC report also provided evidence of three other Russian government Cyber Operations against targets in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada between 2015 and 2017.",

In fall 2014, Usovsky transferred more than $100,000 to pro-Kremlin activists in Poland for the purpose of organizing rallies to protest the government of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The New York Times reported that Usovsky directed projects to target fringe political groups in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine with the financial assistance of Russian government-connected oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.

According to Australian and Dutch investigators, Russia is responsible for downing the passenger jet. EU vs. Disinfo reported that Russian state-sponsored media outlets, such as Lifenews, Rossiya, RT, and many more, continue to falsely claim that Dutch investigators tasked by the international community with investigating the MH17 wreckage found evidence suggesting Ukrainian and EU involvement. The Russian state-sponsored media outlets often falsely allege that Dutch investigators found no evidence implicating Russia or Russian-backed forces in the downing.",

According to Ukraine’s security service (SBU), the hackers manipulated election data in favor of a far-right candidate. SBU agents determined that a CEC administrator planted a virus within internal CEC systems that permitted CyberBerkut to access the CEC’s digital infrastructure and disable the CEC’s election analytics system. Ukrainian officials also noted the presence of malware developed by Russian military intelligence agency (GRU)-connected Fancy Bear, or APT28, on CEC systems. Despite the data breach, CyberBerkut and Fancy Bear did not succeed in changing the ultimate outcome of the election. The Wall Street Journal and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab have linked CyberBerkut, a self-proclaimed independent pro-Russian hacktivist group, to Russian military intelligence agency (GRU)-connected hacking group Fancy Bear, or APT 28.",

The negotiations did not resume until 2016, when the two countries restored diplomatic relations. Norway's fishing, energy, and telecommunications industries had the most to lose in the suspended trade negotiations. In addition, China blocked Norwegian officials, including a former prime minister, from getting visas for travel to China. The Chinese government also kept Norway off a list of countries whose citizens could travel to and stay in Beijing for up to 72 hours without a visa. All other European countries had been put on the approved list. Diplomatic contacts were not restored until December 2016, when Norway issued a statement effectively apologizing for not supporting Chinese sovereignty over its internal affairs. In the intervening period, the Norwegian government had declined a potential 2014 meeting with the Dalai Lama, who China's government considers a separatist.",

The investigation into the Pandora Papers revealed several well-remunerated contracts between Huawei and Jecl via offshore companies based in Panama and the British Virgin Islands. For instance, in 2014 the Chinese tech giant agreed to pay Jecl 359,000 euros (over USD493,000) to organize meetings between Huawei executives and Serbian telecom officials, as well as to help the Chinese giant “obtain approvals and licenses”. The last leaked contract dated to early 2014, but Jecl continued to file invoices through offshore companies into 2016. In 2016, Huawei received a 150-million-euro contract to overhaul Serbian telecommunication infrastructure. In 2017, Huawei became a strategic partner of the Serbian government, notably tasked with helping establish “smart cities” through the “Safe City” project. As of 2021, the Serbian Interior Ministry planned to install 8,100 Huawei facial recognition cameras throughout the country.</p>",

Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stephanovic justified the new role of Chinese police officers by pointing to the increase in Chinese tourists in Serbia since a 2017 agreement to not require visas for travel between Serbia and China. Stephanovic explained that Chinese officers made communication between tourists and the police easier, ensuring the security of tourists. In addition to joint patrols, the Chinese officers operate a Chinese-language emergency phone service and visit the areas in which Chinese businesses and citizens are located. However, though the move was justified as protecting tourists, Smederevo and Novi Sad are not tourist cities. A steel mill bought by a Chinese company in 2016 is the largest direct and indirect employer in Smederevo, and the Budapest-Belgrade railway, commissioned as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative, uses Novi Sad as the key base before the Hungarian border.",

However, a week later, a Huawei Tech Centre opened in Serbia. Belgrade justified the continued partnership by interpreting \"untrusted vendors\" to mean shoddy craftsmanship, making the partnership between Huawei and the state-owned Telecom Serbia a reasonable step to take to ensure the development and implementation of 5G in Serbia.

Since 2014, the project had been discussed and studies carried out in cooperation with the French company Alstom. Two French companies, Powerchina, and members of the Serbian government entered negotiations on the contracts, but the final deal was kept from the public. When Transparency Serbia, the Serbian branch of an NGO that fights corruption, asked for details from the government, the deal was protected as a business secret at the request of Powerchina. Transparency Serbia has accused the deal of being shaped around the needs of the companies involved rather than the needs of the people of Belgrade and of breaking the Law on Public Procurements and the Public-Private Partnership Law. While 80 million euros will be borrowed from France to fund the project, the budget classifies the remaining 500 million as \"project loans with foreign investment corporations, funds and banks.\"",

Under terms that were not made public, Huawei installed cameras with facial and license plate recognition technology in Belgrade. At the end of 2018, 100 cameras were installed at 60 sites. At the beginning of 2019, Serbia made the project public as Huawei added 1000 cameras in 800 sites within Belgrade. Serbian authorities turned down civil society organizations’ information requests on the project. In August 2019, the Personal Data Protection Law, a national law developed to comply with EU standards on data protection, came into effect. This mandated the release of an impact assessment of the project’s data processing. Both the Serbian Commissioner for personal data, as well as local NGOs found that the impact assessment that was eventually completed in September 2019 did not fulfill the Personal Data Protection Law’s requirements. According to Italian think-tank ISPI, Serbian civil society is concerned that the surveillance system is used \"to control and monitor the participants of the anti-government [protests].\" According to Chinese law, Huawei could be required to provide private data to the Chinese government.",

As a result, China EximBank  stepped in and granted Serbia the loans to build the plant. Several Chinese companies, including state-owned Power Construction Corp of China (PowerChina) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) were hired for the construction, which began before the Environmental Impact Survey had been completed in 2015. Moreover, experts who eventually examined the completed Environmental Impact Survey and the Feasibility Assessment determined that they had likely been manipulated as their conclusions were suspect. Despite statements from PowerChina that the plant would be in line with EU environmental impact standards, experts believe that the new plant will cause excessive pollution both within Serbia and in neighboring EU countries. Furthermore, the plant is not financially viable when the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is taken into account. The official Feasibility Assessment assumes both a lower cost of coal than is currently available and a lower cost of carbon allowances than experts believe possible. And while the government announced the completion of the desulphurization unit, meant to reduce pollution, in 2017, there is no evidence that the unit was ever operational. In 2019, the Serbian Ministry of Environmental Protection opened a public consultation on an environmental impact study for the construction of a desulphurization unit, despite the fact that the government had announced its completion two years prior.</p>",

The original idea was to build a high speed railway reaching all the way to the Greek port Piraeus, which state-owned Chinese company COSCO operates. Though there was little demand for trade along the route from Belgrade to Budapest, it was expected that other BRI infrastructure projects would complement this one and generate revenue for the three states. However, rising European distrust of BRI and clashes with European Union regulations have slowed the project and doused European enthusiasm for further contracts. In addition, Serbian concerns over the high price have downgraded the project from a high speed train to a 200 km/hr train. These setbacks are of little concern to Beijing, which profits from the project no matter what. The Export-Import Bank of China is financing 85% of the infrastructure project through loans to Serbia and Hungary. Projections estimate that it will take Serbia thousands of years to pay back the $1.3 billion loan. Furthermore, two Chinese railway companies have been contracted to build the railway, China Railway International and China Communications Construction Company, as well as the Russian RDZ International. In 2020, Hungary classified the documents detailing the project's financing by a Chinese state bank for ten years.",

General Assembly in 2012. CEFC China Energy, a company with links to the United Front, allegedly donated to Jeremic and two other U.N. General Assembly presidents. CEFC helped Jeremic increase his influence, benefiting both parties as Jeremic used this influence to help CEFC establish contacts and make deals. CEFC also arranged speeches and meetings with world leaders, often including both Jeremic and Patrick Ho, a Chinese politician arrested for bribery in November 2017. Having influence inside the U.N. allows Beijing to push for human rights norms which reflect Communist Party values and frame its government's actions in a better light. China uses \"United Front\" work to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP’s United Front Work Department (UFWD)—the agency responsible for coordinating these kinds of influence operations—mostly focuses on the management of potential opposition groups inside China, but it also has an important foreign influence mission.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Hung out outside of the Chinese embassy, at least then of the posters were taken down a few hours afterward, ostensibly by embassy employees. Rhoden is the chairman of the Danish China-Critical Society, and the posters were meant to protest a 2012 partnership accord between Danish health authorities and the Chinese province of Jiangsu. Rhoden has since stated that he asked the Danish Foreign Minister to speak with the Chinese embassy to ensure freedom of speech is respected by all in Denmark.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Given the island's GDP is only about $3 billion, Danish and American officials raised concerns that Chinese completion of the roughly $550 million project would grant Beijing an outsized influence. Chinese investments in the neglected infrastructure of the island could also potentially jeopardize a U.S. military installation at Thule, an air base which houses systems for space monitoring and early warning of ballistic missiles. A foreign affairs spokesman for one of Denmark's governing parties commented that \"we don't want a communist dictatorship in our own backyard.\" As a result of this pressure, CCCC withdrew its bid in June 2019.",

While the ties between Huawei and Chinese authorities are well-documented, this was the first time Xiaomi was explicitly accused of carrying out the CCP's agenda. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Earlier that month, Lithuania had allowed Taiwan to set up a \"Taiwanese\" representative office in Vilnius, deviating from Beijing's preferred designation of \"Taipei\" to name the island. In response, a Chinese state-owned railway operator put the freight link between China and Lithuania \"on hold\" indefinitely. And on August 22, the Baltic Times reported that Chinese authorities had stopped approving new export permits for Lithuanian food exports to China.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The Lithuanian intelligence service's 2019 threat assessment did not name Huawei in its unclassified publication, but alluded instead to \"Chinese companies\" as vectors for intelligence operations. The report mentions tactics targeting influential officials by \"giving gifts, paying for trips to China, covering expenses of training and courses,\" and other inducements to support Chinese positions. In February 2019, Huawei sent its VP of cybersecurity to the region to meet with unnamed government officials, but did not release details of who he contacted or what proposals and incentives were discussed. Although Lithuanian law stipulates that only firms from NATO member states or allied countries are permitted to bid for projects classified as important to national security, two of Lithuania's three main telecom companies, as well as the public broadcaster, already use some Huawei components, and the state-owned energy company is exploring Huawei involvement in its refurbished electrical meters. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.",

Lithuanian Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis more explicitly added that \"[Lithuania] can't afford that China controls Klaipeda port,\" especially in the context of any threat to NATO military access in a crisis. Chinese interest in the project, specifically from China Merchants Group, a state-linked shipping conglomerate, extends as far back as 2011, when the first Chinese cargo trains began transiting the country. The expansion project - estimated to cost roughly 800 million euros - would have formed part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative to link trade and investment across Eurasia with political dependence on China.",

The largest shareholder of Ukio Bank was Lithuanian citizen Vladimir Romanov, who was accused of embezzling 25 million euros from the bank and in 2014 was granted asylum in Russia in order to avoid extradition to Lithuania on embezzlement charges. Another shareholder, Vladimir Antonov, is a Russian national who also held a stake in Lithuania's Snoras Bank. Ukio Bank was placed in administration due to financial troubles, and is alleged to have been used for suspicious transactions by an associate of Vladimir Putin as part of the Panama Papers investigation. The case demonstrated that corrupt businessmen in Lithuania could be used to assist Kremlin in moving money outside of Russia and that they could later count on receiving Moscow's backing so that they would not have to face punishment for their illicit financial activities.",

France’s Areva CEPFi.PA and Westinghouse-Toshiba also bid on the project; however, Atomstroyexport was the only company that offered Belarus financing for the project – a credit line of up to $10 billion to build the plant. This deal further increased Moscow’s leverage over Belarus, a country that is almost entirely dependent on Russian energy. Additionally, it allowed Russia to supply Lithuania, which had recently stopped importing Russian gas, with low-cost energy, further increasing its dependence on Russia. As described by Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas, “Our reliance on Gazprom has ended, now it’s Rosatom. When you stop one weapon, Russia tries another one.” According to the Atlantic Council, Russian-made nuclear power plants rely on imports of specialized parts and fuel from Russian state-owned companies, thereby making the host country entirely dependent on the Russian government for the plant's continued functionality.",

As a result, the refinery was forced to import crude oil supplies by ship and rail, significantly hurting profitability. The Russian government often cites commercial reasons, such as repairs or unpaid debt, when disrupting energy or goods flows for political purposes. Energy security expert Agnia Grigas described the shutdown as a part of Russia's \"political vendetta against Vilnius.\"",

The 20-year loan will be provided by the Export–Import Bank of China, one of the Chinese institutional banks in charge of implementing state policy. The loan should cover roughly 85% of the funding for the rail project, with the Hungarian government funding the remaining 15% and paying annual interest of at least 2.5%. The investment represents a significant portion of the Chinese state's One Belt, One Road initiative, and may eventually link up with other Chinese projects, such as the refurbished Greek port of Piraeus, that aim to secure greater Chinese economic and geostrategic leverage in EU markets.",

Hungarian media suggested that the meeting, nominally to thank the company for the donation, actually concerned Huawei's continued access to the Hungarian market. In November 2019, the Hungarian government had announced that Huawei would take part in the country's 5G network. In addition, Huawei's largest plant outside of China is located in Komarom, Hungary. U.S. and European officials have raised concerns about potential Chinese Communist Party access to data via technical and legal \"backdoors\" embedded in Huawei's infrastructure. Under PRC law, Huawei is obligated to participate in national intelligence work, has been credibly accused of cooperation with PRC intelligence agencies, and is owned ultimately by a trade union entity likely controlled by the CCP.",

The campus is slated to open in 2024 and the agreement raised concerns that Beijing's economic leverage and political influence could harm academic freedom for future students at the institution. Comments from Levente Horváth, a top advisor to Hungary's central bank and a vocal backer of the agreement, that Chinese faculty would train new professors, and that some Chinese professors serve as members of \"state economy advisory boards,\" suggest that the CCP's ideology may be spread further into Hungary's civil society discourse. Lastly, Horváth noted that Chinese companies might pursue research collaboration with the Fudan campus in Budapest, meaning the new campus will be a platform for increased ties between the Chinese and Hungarian economies.",

On the academic side, China-CEE Institute research findings reportedly need to be translated to Chinese, grants for joint research projects note that \"one Chinese institution shall serve as the leading party,\" and a secretariat based in the Chinese Foreign Ministry oversees the grant program for European scholars. In 2017, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a Beijing-based research entity with state backing, opened the institute after the Hungarian Academy of Science backed away from a joint venture.",

After preliminary discussions the previous year, the signing ceremony took place at the China-Central and Eastern Europe (China-CEE) Summit in Belgrade, and details of the design were agreed on in 2015. Originally touted as ready for operation by 2017, the project has instead run into numerous logistical, financial, and political delays, and remained incomplete in 2020. The investment, with precise figures fluctuating but assessed in the billions of euros, represents an early and ambitious portion of the Chinese state's One Belt, One Road initiative, and was expected to eventually link up with other Chinese projects, such as the refurbished Greek port of Piraeus, that aim to secure greater Chinese economic and geostrategic leverage in the European market. European Union authorities opened an infringement procedure against Hungary regarding the project's noncompliance with procurement regulations, but no formal penalty was imposed. In 2020, Hungary classified the documents detailing the project's financing by a Chinese state bank for ten years.",

The deal included a $10.8 billion loan from Russia to help finance the project. Prior to the deal being finalized, the Hungarian parliament passed a new bill that removed the requirement for public competition for such projects and extended the official secrecy of the project terms to 15 years. Opposition officials criticized the bill and the deal and accused Orban of making “secret deals” with Russia that compromise Hungary’s sovereignty and cede influence to Russian energy. According to Reuters, Zoltan Illes, a former lawmaker in Orban's Fidesz party, stated that the deal was merely \"camouflage,\" and that \"for the Russians this is buying influence.\" According to the Atlantic Council, Russian-made nuclear power plants rely on imports of specialized parts and fuel from Russian state-owned companies, thereby making the host country entirely dependent on the Russian government for the plant's continued functionality.",

Confucius Institutes are language and culture centers run by the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Education, which are hosted in more than 500 universities globally. Critics have raised concerns about incidents of infringement upon intellectual freedom at some Confucius Institutes, whose terms of agreement are often hidden. A former head of propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party has called them \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.\" Gergely Salat, who helped open the Confucius Institute in Budapest's Eötvös Loránd University in 2006, admitted when discussing the Chinese vice-directors that they \"do infuence them and inform Hanban [Confucius Institute governing body] what goes on.\" He also said that \"official meetings were just one part of the process. I believe the key was personal contacts and background talks,\" potentially raising concerns that the already opaque language in Confucius Institute governing documents may provide even less protection than anticipated for academic freedom.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

EU and Finnish officials expressed concern that Moscow orchestrated the migrant crisis by directing migrant flows into Finland to extract concessions from Helsinki and to apply pressure on Helsinki to normalize the two countries’ bilateral relationship. Experts argue that migrants could not cross into Finland through Russia without the assistance of Russian security services, as migrant routes traverse zones of military interest in Russia’s northwestern corridor and therefore remain under constant state supervision. Finland reinstated ministerial-level meetings with Russia in 2016 after a multi-year hiatus to resolve the migrant crisis.",

This represents approximately 21 percent of Montenegro national GDP. Two feasibility studies conducted by a French and an American company determined that the highway’s traffic would not be enough to justify its costs. The Financial Times reported in April 2019 that the loan agreement allowed Exim bank to potentially seize Montenegrin land should the country fail to service its debt in time. In addition, any dispute arising from the loan is to be settled in an arbitration court in Beijing, placing Montenegro at a clear disadvantage. The Montenegrin government has most of the documents associated with the highway’s construction as secret.\"</p>",

In a Meduza article, Striga claimed that his organization has the approval of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Aleksey Galitsky is also the top ranking member of the Russian government-connected Night Wolves biker gang in Montenegro.

On March 25, Russian state-sponsored meda outlet Zvezda ran a story about Montenegro under the headline “Crime, minefields and tetanus: why Montenegro has become a danger for tourists.” The following month, Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Montenegro of inflaming “anti-Russian hysteria” and warned that Russians \"may expect provocations and detentions” in the country. According to RFE/RL, tourism is a major industry in Montenegro, and Russian tourists typically account for one-third of all summer-holiday visitors to the country. The Montenegrin Foreign Ministry responded by pointing out the absence of reports of harassment and classified the efforts as “nothing but manipulation and the continuation of a media war that Moscow has been waging against Montenegro, aimed at blocking its accession to NATO.\"",

According to Pierluigi Paganini, member of the European Union’s Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the information gathered “points directly to the Russian APT28 group … In June 2017, after Montenegro officially joined NATO, the attacks continued; experts at the security firm Fire Eye who analyzed them collected evidence that confirmed the involvement of Russia’s APT.”",

According to Bellingcat, “Rather than simply being commemorations or benign events, (these processions) are partly about spreading ideas of a Russian historical claim to territories based on religion and ethnicity.” In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Night Wolves due to their support for Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The Night Wolves traveled to the region \"funded with a grant from the Kremlin,\" according to The New York Times. The bikers visited several churches in Banja Luka, the administrative center of RS. About a week prior, Bosnia's central government banned Night Wolves' leaders Aleksandar Zaldostanov and Sasa Savic from entering the country citing them as threats to national security. Bosnian officials alleged the tour aimed to intimidate non-Serbs in the country. In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Night Wolves due to their support for Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Treasury Department described the group as \"closely connected to the Russian special services.\"</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

Kosovo began weighing a second UNESCO bid in February 2017 after a 2015 attempt failed partially due to concerns over Kosovo’s inability to protect Serbian religious and cultural heritage sites in its territory. According to The Guardian, a successful UNESCO bid would have marked a significant step in Kosovo’s campaign for international recognition. Additionally, the KCSS study reported that both the Russian and Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) believed that UNESCO membership for Kosovo would have represented a “transfer of the SOC monuments in Kosovo to those that destroyed them,” referring to the destruction of UNESCO heritage sites in the 1999 NATO bombing campaign and in further 2004 unrest involving Kosovo Albanians. According to the report, the French language line of effort was part of a much larger disinformation campaign targeted at the predominantly Serbian northern population of Kosovo that aimed to turn Kosovo Serbs against the state.",

Vlasa Mircia, the mayor who approved the deal and sold the land, was shocked by the protests that ran him temporarily out of town, saying, “we never had protests here and suddenly they were everywhere.” The Romanian officials who accused Russia of involvement pointed to Russia’s interest in maintaining its energy monopoly over Europe. According to The Financial Times, advocates of shale gas suggested that Russia was using the Orthodox Church in Romania to shape public opinion, stating that priests led some of the protests.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

According to the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, the activity, which began in 2013, \"represented a systematic, covert attempt to improve  Rossiya Segodnya's online audience across more than a dozen countries €¦ Sputnik was the main beneficiary.\" The activity was designed to build relationships with social media users based on their special interests in order to develop audiences for Russian government-linked disinformation. The network included Sputnik employees who amplified Sputnik content but hid their affiliation. The first operation, which targeted Ukraine, involved 26 pages, 77 accounts, 4 Groups, and 41 Instagram accounts that shared local news stories to hundreds of thousands of followers. The second operation, which targeted the Baltics, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Central and Eastern Europe, involved a network of 289 pages and 75 accounts that included numerous pages focused on general interest topics such as tourism, sports and politics. According to CNN, the accounts and pages spent around $135,000 on ads on Facebook between October 2013 and January 2019. Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, stated in a post \"We identified some technical overlap with Russia-based activity we saw prior to the US midterm elections, including behavior that shared characteristics with previous Internet Research Agency activity.\"",

Chinese supporters of the Hong Kong democracy movement, as well as people from places like Xinjiang or Tibet, and their families are at risk if they draw the CCP’s attention. If their advocacy is discovered, Chinese activists may be fired from jobs at Chinese companies. Even if they are no longer Chinese citizens, they may struggle to get a visa to re-enter the country to see their families, who have to sign a statement that their relatives abroad will not \"destabilize the motherland and disturb social harmony.\" If they are still Chinese citizens, returning home can be even more dangerous. In addition, for Irish residents from Xinjiang or Tibet, catching the attention of the CCP comes with particular risks. A computerized surveillance system in Chinese consulates and embassies flags Uighurs and Tibetans for scrutiny upon entrance. Just the fact that they left can be taken as a signal that their family is not loyal to China, and they may be sent to re-education camps.</p>\r\n<p>[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>",

The attack targeted energy networks running the national grid in the Republic of Ireland, which also covers Northern Ireland. Security analysts believe the hackers intended to access control systems using a massive spear phishing operation. Emails disguised as job applications and complaints were sent to engineers who had access to the control systems. While no disruption was caused, according to British media, \"a number of Industrial Control System engineering and services organisations are likely to have been compromised.\"",

According to the Secure Works, the primary target was the Turkish government, five Turkish banks and two academic networks. Secure Works researchers consider that the PRC-based cyber group Bronze Union \"is likely to view Turkey as a potential target for political and defense intelligence gathering\" especially because the country is a NATO member and U.S. ally.

Macedonian counterintelligence accused Russian agents of attempting to \"influence and offer funds to Macedonian media outlets... in order to spread 'information and disinformation.'\" The documents showed that operations were directed from the Russian embassy in Skopje by three SVR agents, as well as four GRU agents based out of the Russian embassy in Skopje, whose activities were coordinated from a GRU base in Sofia, Bulgaria. Others implicated included local representatives from Russia’s state-sponsored media outlet TASS, and Rossotrudnichestvo. Rossotrudnichestvo is a government-organized non-governmental organization (GONGO) founded in 2008 by President Medvedev as a means to advance Russia’s political and economic interests. According to the Marten’s Centre, it “officially propagandizes the Russian political position.”",

However, according to Reuters, the real reason for the decrease of the supply was Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko's attempts to mend the country's relations with Europe and reluctance to participate in the Eurasian Economic Union, which Russia has pushed as its alternative to the European Union. Lukashenko's pivot to the West was prompted by fears that the Ukrainian situation could repeat itself in Belarus. Transneft’s actions were an attempt to coerce Lukashenko to change his position. Russian state-owned companies, in particular Gazprom, have often allowed their customers to accumulate debt without objection, only to leverage that debt subsequently for political purposes.",

Although unpaid debts were used as justification for the cuts, Gazprom has regularly allowed its customers to accumulate debt without objection, only to later leverage that debt for political purposes.",

According to The New York Times, Bulgaria banned fracking in 2012 and canceled a shale gas license that had been issued to Chevron. Former U.S. and European officials and energy experts outlined an effort by which Russian officials, working with foreign consultancies in Brussels, financially supported anti-fracking activities in several European countries. According to Margarita Assenova, an analyst at the Jamestown Foundation, “at least two Brussels-based consultancies allegedly transferred funds to several Bulgarian environmental groups through local corporate structures connected with Russia. The assets initially went through Overgas, Gazprom’s Bulgarian subsidiary, and the lobby supporting Russian nuclear energy projects. Both have been used in the past to promote Gazprom’s interests.”",

The report falsely accused the Croatian government of persecuting Serbs in Croatia by forcing Orthodox Christians to convert to Catholicism on a large scale. According to BalkanInsight, the idea of forced religious conversion to Catholicism is a highly sensitive issue and calls to mind the fascist regime of Ante Pavelic during World War II, which forced thousands of Serbs to convert to Catholicism. The Serbian Orthodox Church in Croatia denied Russia’s claims about mass forced conversion.",

First, rather than paying money directly to the party, it was sent to the German Ifo Institute as payment for their preparation of the party's economic program used in a 2015 election. Second, it flowed through several foundations, including one tied to energy companies that are themselves connected to a woman who is a close friend of the head of the party and whose money came from an endowment headed by Russian citizen of Ukrainian origin Oksana Dvynskikh, who according to Finnish authorities has close ties to Russian state bank Sberbank through various energy companies she represents.  </p>",
